new Delhi, Where on the one hand, the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Russia Ukraine War) is at its peak. At the same time, various types of videos are becoming viral on social media regarding this war. In this sequence, now a new video is going viral on social media, in which it is being claimed by the supporters of Ukraine that, Russia is now using Medical Vehicles or Ambulance to bring ammunition to the battlefield. In order to deliver.

why is ‘+’ sign

In fact, in this video that came on reddit, you can see that a medical vehicle or say an ambulance is being used by Russia to deliver ammunition to the war. If you look closely, the ‘+’ sign is clearly visible in the vehicle seen in the video, which is usually used for medical vehicles or ambulances. At the same time, you will also be able to see a ‘Z’ sign in this vehicle. Now after all, what is this mark being used for, we also tell you that.

What ‘Z’ meaning of symbols

Actually, if you look carefully at the tanks and vehicles of the Russian army, you will find that ‘Z’ is written on them, but with some changes. For example, ‘Z’ is written in some places and somewhere it is written in the box. At the same time, there are some Russian vehicles in which ‘Z’ is written in a triangle. It can have different meanings in war, which it is designed to explain.

At the same time, according to a report in ‘Telegraph’, this type of mark is used for Rosgvardia Troops. Rosvardia Troops means Russian National Guard. This is different from the soldiers of the army. In fact, ‘Rosvardia Troops’ directly informs about every action of theirs directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In fact, the Rosvardia Troops, which are connected to the ‘Z’ mark, have also received intensive training to capture and infiltrate anywhere. At the same time, some also believe that this mark is made so that the Russian army does not accidentally target its vehicles. Those on which it is on the mark, it means that they are the vehicles of the Russian army. So this is the ‘+’ and ‘Z’ sign’s connection to Russia.",https://www.businesskhabar.com/world/ukraines-claim-russia-is-transporting-ammunition-through-medical-vehicles-watch-sensational-video/

A video of a goods train carrying armoured tanks and military equipment has gone viral with the claim that this was Russian weaponry on its way to Ukraine.

This video along with the claim went viral on Facebook at the time when, as per the news reports, Russia sent a 40-mile-long convoy to the northern side of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

One of the Facebook posts sharing the viral video claimed, “Russia has sent lots of Arms, Tanks, Weapons to the capital city of Ukraine on a Goods Train which is VIRTUALLY ENDLESS!”

The India Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found this video was not from Russia or Ukraine at all. It was first uploaded to YouTube in 2012 and shows a Canadian National Railways train carrying ground force equipment for the Canadian armed forces.

AFWA probe

Looking carefully at the viral video, we saw “CN” written on the locomotive engine. The engine number mentioned at the top was “2235”. The logo for the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian freight railway company, is similar to the “CN” seen on the engine.

We tried to find the original video with the help of the InVID tool and reverse image search. We found that the viral video has been on the internet for several years now.

Initial searches on Yandex or on Google, however, led us to YouTube videos that claimed it showed Russian forces.

But since we suspected the locomotive to belong to the Canadian National Railway, we kept searching for the original video. On Bing, the reverse image search results yielded the same viral video on YouTube with the title, “CN 2235, CN 8803 - Ultra Rare Canadian Military Train - Westbound - Lovekin, ON.”

The Amnesty YouTube DataViewer showed the video was uploaded on YouTube on August 30, 2012.

The details on YouTube about the video read, “Rare sighting of CN 2235 & 8803 moving a large division of the Canadian Armed Forces ground force equipment and some empty autocars westbound.” It is the same engine number that is visible in the viral video.

Geolocating the viral video

Since we could not find any credible news report regarding the video, we tried to geolocate the spot on the viral video.

As written in the title of the YouTube video, the train was Westbound and the place mentioned was “Lovekin, ON”. Lovekin is located in Ontario, Canada.

The website of the Toronto Railway Historical Association noted that Lovekin was “One of the best locations to view railroads in Ontario!” The website added, “The spot is located at the eastern edge of the Greater Toronto Area, south of the town of Newcastle on Lakeshore Road just a short distance from Lake Ontario.”

This website also published winter photos of Lovekin and the spot from where the railway lines are visible. Even though these photos were taken in the winter when the terrain was mostly covered by snow, the spot looked similar to the viral and the YouTube video.

With the help of Google Maps, we found the exact location where the viral video was shot. We cross-checked it with Google Street View.

The viral video was likely shot from an elevated location or from a bridge. We found on Google Street View a wooden bridge on Lakeshore Road overlooking the railway tracks.

Comparing the screengrab of the viral video, the YouTube video, and the Google Street View image, we found similar elements, like the electrical posts, another railway track beside the one on which the locomotive was running, and the same cluster of trees on the horizon.

From this evidence, we can conclude that a 2012 video of the Canadian National Railway in Lovekin, Ontario was falsely shared as the recent military movement of Russian forces in Ukraine.

A Ukrainian voice interrogates them. “Speak,” he says to the group’s Russian officer. What message would he like to send to his soldiers and to Russians back at home?

“Frankly speaking, they tricked us,” the officer replies, referring to his military superiors sitting in Moscow. “Everything we were told was a fake. I would tell my guys to leave Ukrainian territory. We’ve got families and children. I think 90% of us would agree to go home.”

The three-minute video was filmed under conditions of duress. The soldiers are evidently scared. And yet there are numerous similar interviews with Russian captives which have been circulating on Ukrainian social media channels, expressing similar sentiments.

Asked what he would tell his commanders, one said bluntly: “They are faggots”. Another phrase frequently used is oni obmanuli nas: they duped us. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight. Some have given themselves up.

Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians.

But low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. The assumption in Moscow was that the operation would be swift and successful. Soldiers were given food and fuel supplies for only two or three days, the videos suggest.

The Kremlin also appears to have had a totally fantastical idea of the reception they would get. Several prisoners of war said they had been assured Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators. Russian forces were expecting flowers and cheers, not bullets and bombs, they said.

“Some of them thought they were on military exercises. They didn’t anticipate resistance,” Artem Mazhulin, a 31-year-old English teacher from Kharkiv said. “A lot are conscripts born in 2002 or 2003. We are talking about 19-year-old and 20-year-old boys.”

He added: “Since 2014 the Russian government has been brainwashing its population with propaganda. They try and make Russia believe Ukraine is not a real country and say fascist monsters have captured it.”

Mazhulin said his uncle and aunt, Viktor and Valentina, had talked with Russian soldiers when they rolled past their house in Kupiansk, in north-east Ukraine, close to the border. The soldiers explained they were looking for Banderivtsi, or followers of the second world war Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera.

“My uncle said to them: ‘Where the fuck do you see Banderivtsi?’ My aunt told them to get off her flowerbeds,” Mazhulin recounted. “They called my uncle Batya (Dad) and chatted with him about pigeon breeding, his hobby. Then they drove off on their tank.”

In a video address on Thursday Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pressed home the same message: that Putin has sent his invading forces into Ukraine without an understandable mission. “They are demoralised. They are doomed,” he said, telling enemy soldiers to “go home”.

Ukraine claims to have killed several thousand Russian troops. This figure may be an exaggeration, but on Wednesday, however, even the Kremlin admitted 498 of its servicemen had died, with 1,591 wounded.

Alex Kovzhun, a one-time adviser to Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said Russian soldiers could be divided into two sorts: “There are the young conscripts who are scared shitless. And there are career guys who have fought in Syria and the Donbas.”

Kovzhun said the Russian general staff had thought the invasion would be “easy peasy”, and a repeat of the operations to seize Crimea in 2014, or their recent deployment to Kazakhstan, which were largely unopposed. Instead, Ukrainian civilians had stood in front of enemy tanks, blocked armoured columns with their bare hands and had sung the national anthem in front of twitchy Russian guards.

“They shout expletives in front of armed people. I’ve seen the Russian faces. They are very uncomfortable because it’s not what they expected. They were told Ukrainians were imprisoned by mythic Nazis,” he added.

Nick Reynolds, a research analyst for land warfare at the defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said the Ukrainian figure for killed enemy soldiers was likely to be a more reliable than the Russian estimate, adding that the footage of engagements involving Russian forces available online suggested the toll the Kremlin was willing to admit to had already been exceeded.

Nevertheless, he added, there is little to show how the Ukrainian authorities have arrived at their own total. The several thousand dead tally could itself be a slight exaggeration, he said.

There is no doubt Ukraine is utilising the discomfort of captured soldiers for propaganda purposes. Several videos show young men calling their mothers back in Russia, who have no idea their sons are fighting in Ukraine. The mothers typically break down. The Ukrainian authorities have opened a hotline for worried Russian relatives, in another PR scoop.

Nonetheless, there is an authentic sense that many Russian servicemen regret ever having come to Ukraine, a journey that has ended for some in death or disillusionment. One interrogator asks a prisoner: “So, what do you think, are you soldiers of the strong Russian army or cannon fodder?”

“We are cannon fodder,” the PoW replies.

“Was it worth it?” the interrogator says, by way of follow-up.

“No,” the prisoner says.

Rasputitsa.

Rasputitsa refers to two particular times of the year—in fall when the rains hit, and in spring as the snow melts. These are the moments when the region’s clay-laden soil becomes saturated with precipitation, and unpaved roads transform into mud so relentlessly deep and sticky that a truck’s front axle can be swallowed whole, and even treaded tanks have difficulty traversing the ground. The natural phenomenon has offered Russia one of its greatest defense tactics through history. Rasputitsa thwarted Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812. Rasputitsa prevented Germany from occupying Moscow in 1942. But, as Ukraine’s daytime temperatures creep above freezing, it’s Russia, ironically—and its vast armament of tanks and troop transporters—that’s about to be on the receiving end of rasputitsa. The consequences may be dire for Putin as he attempts to make claim of a muddy country with a landmass that’s roughly the size of Texas—particularly because experts I’ve spoken to believe he underestimated the importance of one of the most important aspects of any modern war: the supply chain.

advertisement

Ukraine and Russia are both vulnerable to their own supply chain issues, which will impact how the battle plays out over the coming days, weeks, and months. “I do think one of the ways to think about this is very much like COVID-related supply chain issues,” says David Stone, professor of Russian studies at the Naval War College. “The other analogy would be a big natural disaster, a hurricane or snowstorm that shuts everything down. But being in the middle of a war takes all that and makes things worse.” Ukraine needs bullets and missiles, and it may soon need food and other resources Russia could block from reaching cities. Russia requires these same things. But, even more so, it needs almost unfathomable amounts of gasoline to keep its 40-mile–long invasion moving—lest it get stuck in the mud. Ukraine needs food, infrastructure, and bullets At the moment, Ukraine can still get supplies into the country through its western border of NATO allies. Its supply chain flows from this route, but whether or not these supplies can actually reach their key strategic cities is a larger challenge that Russia is already exploiting.

So far, Russia has attacked from everywhere else: north, east, and south. As Russian troops advanced, Ukraine responded with a textbook maneuver of self-sabotage. It destroyed its own bridges in those regions. “The purpose of that is to stop the Russians from advancing across that bridge,” says Stone. “If they do, then it’s [still] a bottleneck to resupply Russian troops.” (Typically, tools like armored-vehicle-launched bridges—what are essentially tank bottoms with retractable bridges on top—help mitigate some broken bridge crossings.) But as far as anyone can tell, the bridges to Ukraine’s west—leading to NATO countries like Poland—have not been targeted by Russian jets. This leaves a relatively clear line for transporting weapons from the U.S. and Canada to reinforce Ukrainian troops, along with food to feed its citizens. For now.

Already, Russia surrounded the port city of Kherson before seizing it, cutting off Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea, and the city of Mariupol is currently encircled. As Russia descends on the capital city of Kyiv, experts I spoke to agreed that it’s likely we’ll see the city encompassed by Russian troops, choking off any supplies from coming in or out. While Russia could then invade in a destructive, block-by-block battle, it’s also possible that it may sit tight to starve the city out. Again, it’s an old technique, used by the Germans against Russia in 1941 during the siege of Leningrad, notes William Reinsch, who holds the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “They have to be completely surrounded,” explains Reinsch, comparing it to the so-called 900-day siege that caused widespread famine and a million deaths in Leningrad. “If there’s one exit and entry ramp, this doesn’t work.” Over the last week, we’ve seen Ukrainians form long lines for groceries and pharmaceuticals—and that’s with supply chains running relatively smoothly. Now, Kyiv’s grocers are running out of food, though such reports may not tell the whole story.

“I think the first thing is that we don’t exactly know what the stores of essentials are in places like Kyiv, or any Ukrainian cities being attacked,” says Bradley Martin, the director of Rand’s National Security Supply Chain Institute. “They have whatever was on hand when the wars started . . . though it may very well be that knowing the siege was coming, Ukrainians have done a good job stockpiling.” Ukraine is actually the world’s fourth largest exporter of grain, but this is not harvest season. And no expert knows how much food individual Ukrainians actually have stockpiled inside their own homes. “I think probably for anything prolonged, the issue of food becomes larger than anything else. Large cities have hospitals, infirmaries, pharmacies . . . they probably have stocks of medical equipment and things people need,” says Reinsch. “What they might not have is enormous supplies of food because they’re used to getting stuff from the farm. Plus, it’s perishable. If you’re talking about drugs, [medical] supplies, those can last for months. If you’re talking grain and vegetables, you have to have a constant flow. So that’s a much greater challenge.”

advertisement

Russia might also shut off major cities from water and electricity, which would be devastating. Mariupol is currently without electricity, and notably, Russian troops recently seized the largest nuclear reactor in Ukraine. “Any part of the infrastructure is going to be gone, controlled by the Russians,” says Martin. Ukrainian citizens have stockpiled weapons for years, fearing Russian conflict. But they also need bullets and other armaments like anti-tank missiles, to defend themselves from invasion. Both the U.S. and Canada have committed weapons to Ukrainian defense, which will likely be coming in from the NATO line in the west, via Poland. “What’s going to happen, even if [Putin] takes over . . . is guerrilla warfare and insurgency,” says Reinsch. “In cities, that’s not hard. They hide in basements . . . and at night they shoot Russian soldiers on patrol.”

advertisement

Assuming that Ukraine has the international support to source enough weapons, its advantage in bringing in munitions is that they are small. That makes it easy for Ukraine to move critical weapons, key to its resistance, in a compact package that’s hard to intercept. Russian tanks are big and hard to miss. But hundreds of anti-tank missiles needed to stop them can fit on just a few trucks. These weapons of guerrilla warfare are both devastating and compact, meaning they are relatively easy to move through a supply line. Ukrainians might not be able to sneak these weapons into a city past a full Russian blockade, but they could help Ukraine battle Russia everywhere else across the country. Namely, these missiles could exploit glaring weaknesses in Russia’s own supply chain—especially with the help of the region’s legendary mud. Russia didn’t bring enough gas Like Ukraine, Russia also needs a steady supply of food and armaments. But Russia’s ground invasion requires an even more pressing need: gas.

advertisement

While Ukraine is undoubtedly outgunned in this war, the Russian military already shows signs of being slowed by its own size. The 40-mile-long tank convoy outside Kyiv does not appear to have moved much in the past few days. Experts concur that the reason is probably a lack of fuel. Stone points out that an American M1 tank, for instance, gets atrocious gas mileage—an average of about 0.3 miles per gallon. In other words, every mile that a single tank drives requires three gallons of gas. Personnel carriers transporting Russia’s troops need gas, too. This fuel is not compact and easy to transport like explosives. Gas is bulky, and requires tankers to move. Wouldn’t Russia have known this from previous wars, and planned for it?

advertisement

“It looks as though Russian planning was pretty shabby,” says Stone, “that there was not a lot of careful thought of the operational requirements of what would be necessary. “Ukraine is a big place. The Russians don’t seem to have thought very hard about what that meant, particularly the logical problem of keeping fuel and ammunition up to front-line units.” Stone points out, as many have, that Russia appears to have entered Ukraine expecting little to no resistance, and so it underestimated its need to secure a clean chain for fuel. As a proof point of this theory, Stone notes that Russia dropped paratroopers—elite, highly trained personnel who travel light but require immediate backup by a full army—at an airport outside Kyiv right as the war broke out. But the support tanks were still hundreds of miles away. “To drop paratroopers outside Kyiv like that is to assume Ukrainians wont fight,” says Stone.

advertisement

An essential point about the entire supply “chain” metaphor is that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Every tank or transporter doesn’t need to run out of fuel to slow, or even block, an invasion. It just takes a few weak links to break down an entire, otherwise efficient, system. “You’ve got this 40-mile convoy of tanks on just a regular highway. Well, if they’re all stalled, how do you get fuel to them?” muses Reinsch. “It’s complicated.” The Russian convoy’s weak links in the chain are only made worse by rasputitsa. If a tank is blocking a road, vehicles need to drive around it by going off-road. And the rasputitsa is only made worse thanks to another piece of poor Russian military planning: vehicle maintenance.

advertisement

This is a thread that will explain the implied poor Russian Army truck maintenance practices based on this photo of a Pantsir-S1 wheeled gun-missile system's right rear pair of tires below & the operational implications during the Ukrainian mud season.???? 1/ pic.twitter.com/LmxW43v6gy — Trent Telenko (@TrentTelenko) March 2, 2022 Military tires are built to endure heavy loads and avoid flats, so they’re formulated with dense, strong materials that are different than the tires for your average car. But especially when stored under the wrong conditions—like if exposed to too much sunlight—these tires can break down. Without optimum tire pressure, they crumble. Early analysis by retired U.S. Defense Contract Management Agency member Trent Telenko shows just this phenomenon happening to Russian vehicles in Ukraine. And as such, the parts of the Russian convoy that do have fuel are stuck on the street because they can’t handle the mud.

advertisement

“One explanation I’ve heard for the 40-mile traffic jam outside Kyiv is an inability to go off-road because of [the combination of] mud and tires,” says Stone. “American-style multi-lane superhighways are very [rare] on the ground. Even a paved road, if it’s only two-lane, can present real traffic problems if a lot of big clumsy equipment has to go down it.” Russia will figure out how to get fuel to this line eventually, Martin argues, but that inevitably involves fuel tankers, which need to snake their way up already congested conditions. Airdropping fuel may be feasible but in far more limited quantities. But these fuel tankers aren’t a perfect solution in a contested war zone because, unlike the tanks they support, they are soft skinned. They don’t have heavy armor. “You don’t necessarily need an anti-tank missile to take it out,” says Stone. “If I were the Ukrainian military, I’d plan to attack those resupply lines.” Destroying gas tankers is not the way to win the war, but these lightweight attacks on Russia’s supply line can do something indirectly important: slow down Russia long enough that this war becomes economically unfeasible to support. Because while NATO countries aren’t attacking Russia, they are placing economic sanctions on it—which are already wreaking havoc on Russia’s economy. “I think Ukraine can hold out for a very long period of time,” says Martin. “It may lose lose several cities, but it can defend itself a long time because its supply chains [in NATO countries] are well-defended. Russia’s supply chains they’ll figure out, but . . . they may find themselves in [economic] trouble more quickly. I would call that supply chain vulnerability at the strategic level. Money buys supplies.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/90727935/as-russia-bombards-ukraine-it-could-become-a-battle-between-two-supply-chains

The post included a video showing Russian ambulances with deadly weapons and ammunition, according to the tvp.info website.

Earlier, the Ukrainian army said that Russian troops were using in Ukraine two particularly devastating types of bombs prohibited by international law, cluster bombs and thermobaric, or ""vacuum,"" bombs, the Polish website reported.

The International Criminal Court has started an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine, following a request from 39 of the court's member states.

Meanwhile, Poland's Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro told reporters in Warsaw this week that he had ""ordered Poland's prosecution service to open an investigation into the crime of aggressive war"" against Ukraine.

Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau told the United Nations on Wednesday that Russia's authorities were showing contempt for human rights in their assault on Ukraine and its people.

The UN General Assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to reprimand Russia for invading Poland's eastern neighbour and demanded that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its forces from Ukraine, the Reuters news agency reported.

The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the assembly that Russia was poised to intensify the brutality of its offensive and urged members to hold Moscow accountable for its violations of international law, Reuters reported.

She cited videos of Russian troops moving heavy weapons into Ukraine, including cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, banned under international law, according to Reuters.
