According to Haidai: ""The Russian army has been relentlessly shelling the Hirske hromada (municipality - ed.) for almost two days, keeping the local residents in fear. During the day, the enemy’s multiple rocket launchers opened volley fire on the town of Zolote. Several buildings are burning, and at least five people have been wounded.

Not taking into account the situation in Zolote, where the count of damaged property continues, over the course of today the enemy has destroyed 11 properties, 8 of which are residential buildings in Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kreminna, and Zolote.""",https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/04/8/7338195/
1,22cdecfb-392a-4b87-903d-8603c9e91dbd,[],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

The Centre for Defense Strategies (CDS) is a Ukrainian security think involved in security studies, defense policy research and advocacy. This is CDS’s analysis of the main events of Russia’s war against Ukraine as of April 8.

Humanitarian aspect

Kramatorsk. Russian forces attacked Kramatorsk train station with a ballistic missile TochkaU on the morning of April 8. About 4,000 people were at the station at the moment of the missile strike, primarily families with children, as residents of the Donetsk region are being evacuated to safer areas of Ukraine.

Видео дня

It is reported that 52 people are dead, five of them were children. More than 100 civilians were wounded.

Kramatorsk hospitals cannot cope with the number of wounded after a missile attack.

""Many people are heavily injured; they lost arms and legs. 30- 40 surgeons operate on them simultaneously,"" said the mayor of Kramatorsk.

A photo of part of the Russian rocket that hit the rail station was published; it has a handwritten inscription in Russian ""for the children [missing part].""

An emergency evacuation has started in Kramatorsk. Latest UN data on civilians killed in Ukraine: a total of 1,611 civilian deaths have been confirmed, including 131 children, 2227 people were injured.

Office of Ukraine's Prosecutor General reports that more than 475 children suffered in Ukraine due to the full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation: 169 children were killed, and more than 306 were injured.

However, the data is not final since the information collection continues in the areas of intensive fighting and the territories temporarily occupied by the enemy, Ukrainian Ombudswoman Lyudmila Denisova stated that Russian invaders forcibly took over 120,000 Ukrainian children to Russia.

She also reports cases of rape of minors: in Bucha, a 14- year-old girl was raped by five male occupiers, she is pregnant now; an 11-year-old boy was raped in front of his mother, she was tied to a chair to watch. More than 30,000 people have been illegally deported to Russia from Mariupol.

On April 8, ten humanitarian corridors have been agreed to evacuate residents of the Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk regions. А total of 6,665 people has been evacuated today.

5,158 people (1,614 Mariupol residents and 3,544 residents of Berdyansk, Melitopol, Polohy, Vasylivka, Tokmak, Enrgodar, Orikhiv, Huliaypole) reached Zaporizhzhia by their own transport and buses via humanitarian corridors. In the Luhansk region: 1,507 people were evacuated from Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, and Kreminna.

In Melitopol, the occupying forces have been detaining eight evacuation buses for 24 hours. Almost the entire convoy of buses with humanitarian aid on their way to Melitopol for further evacuation of people was captured by the Russian military.

According to the head of the Zaporizhzhya regional administration, drivers were told to gather in one of the buses and return to the departure point. The rest of the buses were confiscated by the Russian invaders. At night in the Kharkiv region, the gas pipeline was significantly damaged due to enemy shelling.

Over the past 24 hours, Russian occupation forces have fired about 48 artillery, mortars, tanks, and rocket-propelled grenades at the Saltivka, Pyatihatok, Oleksiyivka, central Kharkiv, and Derhachi districts.

Fifteen people were injured. On the morning of April 7, the enemy shelled a boat in which civilian Ukrainians tried to leave the occupied territory of the Kherson region.

As a result, four people were killed, including a child. Seven others were injured, and two are missing. People were sailing from the Kherson region to the village of Maryanka in the Dnipro region.

According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the invaders fired Grad missiles at them The exhumation of bodies buried in mass graves began in Bucha. The largest mass grave of civilians killed by the Russian invaders was discovered.

Police, investigators, and criminologists are working on the scene. According to Kyiv Region Police Chief Andriy Nebytov, the civilians were buried by one of the town utility services workers. He stayed in Bucha and asked the invaders to allow him to take people from the streets they were shot in and bury them so that they would not remain on the streets. He was doing that under enemy fire. The bullet wounds are visible on the bodies; many people died from gunshots or sniper rifles.

Experts will later determine the cause of death. The Russian occupiers shot dead at least 132 residents of the village of Makariv in the Kyiv region. Twenty-six bodies were found after clearing the rubble of just two apartment buildings in Borodyanka, Kyiv region.

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova stated that the rescue search has just begun, so the number of identified victims of Russian military crimes will increase. Since the beginning of the war, about 700 people, both military and civilian, have died in Chernihiv, according to the city mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko.

Operational situation

The strategic air-ground offensive operation of the Russian Armed Forces against Ukraine continues. Since April, Russians have changed its title to the 'Donbas Defense Operation.

During 44 days of fighting, the enemy partially fulfilled the task of establishing the land corridor from Russia's territory through the Ukrainian Donbas to the temporarily occupied Crimea and attempts to occupy the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions within their administrative borders.

The enemy's primary efforts are to capture Mariupol, develop an offensive near Izyum, and try to break through the defenses in the Donetsk direction. At the same time, the enemy continues to prepare for an offensive in eastern Ukraine.

The invaders are regrouping in order to form an offensive grouping, increase the number of air components, command and control, and continue to conduct reconnaissance. Separate units of the Russian Eastern Military District and the airborne troops, restoring combat capability and regrouping in Belarus, will probably be sent to strengthen the Russian grouping in the Slobozhansky direction.

The enemy is completing the restoration of combat capability of the Central Military District units in the areas of the Bryansk and Kursk regions. The Russian Air Force has relocated most of its aircraft and at least 20 of the 150 helicopters from airbases in Belarus to airbases in southeastern Russia over the past week. The primary efforts of the Russian Air Force are concentrated in the Kharkiv-Izyum-Luhansk-Donetsk districts, and they make about 320-350 flights a day. The main targets are Ukrainian command posts and depots. The Russian occupation authorities continue to restrict the rights of Ukrainian citizens in the territories under their control.

Thus, in the Zaporizhzhya region, Russian invaders banned the exit of males towards the territory controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. There is also an increase in the shortage of essential goods, especially food, which could further complicate the humanitarian situation in the temporarily occupied territories.

Due to the heavy losses of Russian personnel during their hostilities in Ukraine, the military commissariats of the Russian Western Military District received an additional task to select candidates for military service under a contract to resupply military units that had lost their combat capability. The Ukrainian Defense Forces, inflicting damage on the enemy, continue to push back them back and liberate the temporarily occupied territories.

The Ukrainian Air Forces continue to strike the areas of enemy concentration. The morale of the invasion force personnel remains low and tends to deteriorate. The servicemen refuse to take part in further hostilities in Ukraine.

As it turns out, Russian citizens do not want to join the military service under the contract, understanding they would soon be sent to the war zone in Ukraine. In March of this year, only 11 servicemen were admitted to military service under contract in the Western Military District: in the 1st tank army - 8; in the 6th combined arms army - 2; in the 20th combined arms army - not a single one; in the Baltic Fleet - 1. Due to the failure to fulfill the recruitment plan (the plan is 3,000 contract soldiers), the commander of the Western Military District, Colonel-General Zhuravlev, plans to remove Major General Belyavsky from the post of the head of the district's personnel.

To avoid panic and protests among Russian citizens, the dead bodies of Russian soldiers of the 331st Airborne Regiment (military unit 71211, Kostroma) from the 98th Airborne Division (military unit 65451, Ivanovo) are brought back to Russia in small batches.

Volyn operational area: there is a possibility of enemy missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure from the territory of Belarus. The Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus carry out operational and combat training activities throughout the country. Up to four BTGs have been involved in tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border.

According to the available information, the so-called ""volunteers"" from Belarus are being recruited to new units of a private military company (information to be confirmed).

Polissya operational area: the enemy did not take any active actions. The enemy's units, withdrawn to the territory of Belarus, carry out activities to prevent Ukraine's Defense Forces from transferring to other areas. Siversky operational area: the enemy completes the regrouping and restoration of combat capability of the Central Military District units that were previously withdrawn from Ukraine to the Bryansk and Kursk regions of the Russian Federation.

The possibility of further involvement of these units in hostilities in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas remains. Slobozhansky operational area: Separate units from the 6th and 20th combined-arms armies, the 1st tank army, and the coastal troops of the Baltic and northern fleets are carrying out operational equipment of the territory.

The primary task is to restore railway sections from Kupyansk to railway stations in Kharkiv, Izyum, and Svatove. For this purpose, units of the 38th separate railway brigade of the Western Military District (permanent deployment base - Yaroslavl) were involved.

In the Kharkiv region, up to five enemy BTGs continue to blockade the city and fire with MLRS, artillery, and mortars. To prevent the advance of Ukrainian troops, the invaders put up minefields. Yesterday, the Russian Air Force struck at the Lozova railway junction and the railway stations in Izyum and Slovyansk, from which civilians are being evacuated. The invaders are holding Izyum and trying to continue the offensive in the direction of Sloviansk and Barvinkove.

In the temporarily occupied Izyum, representatives of the so-called ""Donetsk republic"" perform the local ""police"" functions and carry out illegal checks of documents. They do personal searches and searches of the residences of the local population.

Donetsk operational area: the enemy continues fire and assault operations, launches missile and bomb strikes, and artillery fire on the civilian infrastructure. The enemy also intensified efforts in the Severodonetsk direction, trying to continue the offensive in the areas of Donetsk, Novotoshkivske, and Popasna.

They are advancing in the areas of Maryinka, Borivske, and Solodke. The enemy continues to launch airstrikes and shell civilian infrastructure, including MLRS in the areas of Kreminna, Severodonetsk, Novotoshkivske, Popasna, Novozvanivka, Sukha Balka, Novoselivka Druha, Stepne, Troitske, and Novobahmutovka. Likely, the invaders will soon try to break through the Ukrainian defense in the Severodonetsk, Avdiivka, and Kurakhov districts.

In the areas of Rubizhne, Popasna, Nyzhne, Novotoshkivske, Zolote, and Borivske, the invaders tried to carry out unsuccessful assault operations. In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, seven enemy attacks were repulsed in the past 24 hours. Ukrainian Defense Forces destroyed four tanks, two artillery systems, ten armored units, and eleven enemy vehicles.

Tavriya operational area: the port of Berdyansk is used by the Russian invaders to transfer weapons, military equipment, and personnel. Pivdennobuzhsky operational area: the enemy conducts artillery fire on positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It uses aircraft in some directions and tries to continue offensive operations in the direction of Alexandrovka.

Azov-Black Sea Maritime Operational Area: Enemy naval strike groups in the Black and Azov Seas continue to launch missile strikes on Ukraine, isolating the combat zone and reconnaissance area. In the coastal direction, Russian troops are concentrating their efforts on capturing Ukrainian cities and ports in the Black and Azov Seas. The sea siege of Odesa continues.

Russian troops continue to launch missile strikes from the sea, from surface ships, submarines, and from the territory of the occupied Crimea. Last night Odesa was attacked, as well as military units defending the city. The cities of Mykolaiv and Ochakiv were also hit by missiles from the Black Sea.

Casualties were reported. Active defense of Mykolaiv continues. The occupants continue shelling Mykolayiv with missiles and aircraft. Ukrainian defense forces keep the enemy on the border of the Kherson region, counterattack, and shell clusters of enemy vehicles.

The situation in Mariupol remains difficult. The enemy is destroying civilian infrastructure, capturing part of the city. Ukrainian troops continue to maintain a circular defense. The enemy suffers losses in strength and equipment.

Dnipro. The Dnipro region, the Russian invaders fired on civilians during the evacuation. As a result, four people died, including one child;

Zaporizhzhia. As a result of the April 7 shelling, low- and medium-pressure gas distribution pipelines in the towns of Huliaipole and Orikhiv were damaged.

In total, there are 62,267 residencies without gas supply in 53 villages and towns in the oblast;

Mariupol. On the night of April 8, in the Mariupol trading port, the Russian invaders fired at the ""Captain Belousov"" icebreaker carrying a civilian crew. One person was killed in the shelling;

Odesa. Last night, from the territory of Crimea, the enemy launched a missile strike with three guided missiles at the Odesa region. Two buildings were damaged. The number of victims is being clarified.

Sumy. On the morning of April 8, Russian troops shelled the Shostka district in the Sumy region; • Electricians of the Trostyanets operational brigade ""Sumienergo"" exploded on an antitank mine. One died, and two are in critical condition in the hospital.

The total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 08.04 were approximately personnel - almost 19,000 people (+100); tanks - 700 (+12); armored combat vehicles (BBM) - 1891 (0); operational tactical missile systems - 4 (0); artillery systems - 333 (+1); multiple rocket launchers (MLRS) - 108 (0); air defense equipment - 55 (0); aircraft - 150 (0); helicopters - 135 (0); automotive equipment - 1361 (+3); boats / ships - 7 (0); UAV - 112 (+16).

Ukraine in general:

Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense has published a new list of Russian invaders who took part in the genocide of the Ukrainian people in the Kyiv region.

The list includes full names, military ranks, positions, and mobile and satellite phones of the Russian National Guard servicemen in Khabarovsk who took part in the genocide of the people of Ukraine in the Kyiv region. It can be found at the following link.

According to the chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on finances, Danilo Getmantsev, 220 Ukrainian enterprises have already been relocated from the war zone to safer areas.

Ninety of them have already resumed working. More than 40% of the planned agricultural areas have already been sown in the Dnipro region. Ukraine's daily state budget expenditures related to the war amount to about UAH 2 billion.

At the same time, the total Ukrainian losses associated with the destruction of infrastructure and loss of the economic potential amount to $4 billion a day, stated Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.

Energy security: As of 10 a.m. on April 8, 2022, all operating nuclear power plants in Ukraine are stably producing electricity. The total current capacity of power units provides the necessary amounts of electricity for the country's needs. Radiation, fire, and environmental conditions at the industrial sites of nuclear power plants and adjacent territories have not changed and are within current standards.

Russian occupation forces destroyed the long-standing archive collected by Ukrainians at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Almost all office premises in buildings in the Chornobyl zone were significantly damaged, broken, and thoroughly plundered.

The invaders seized not only the property of state-owned enterprises but also the personal belongings of workers at their workplaces. In addition, a modern analytical laboratory worth 6 million euros was looted and destroyed in Chornobyl. It was a unique complex with powerful analytical capabilities.

It could provide services at any stage of radioactive waste management, as well as at the stage of research and development of technology.

Experts say it is extremely dangerous to visit and stay in the Chornobyl zone now due to the consequences of the presence of Russian armed forces. There are high radiation risks, explosion threats, and logistical barriers.

International diplomatic aspect:

The UN General Assembly has suspended Russia's membership in the Human Rights Council. 93 states supported this decision. 24 countries voted against, including 5 countries of the former Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, and others. 58 countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, India, Brazil, and South Africa, abstained.

The Russian delegation even tried to mislead that Moscow had left the Council on its own. Russia believes that the decision of the UN General Assembly is ""an illegal and politically motivated step to demonstratively punish a sovereign UN member state that pursues an independent domestic and foreign policy."" Disagreements with the ""politicization"" of human rights issues and the ""protection"" of sovereignty in domestic and foreign policy issues influenced China's position.

Beijing reacts sharply to criticism of its ""internal"" affairs, particularly the curtailment of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong and the systematic oppression of the Uyghurs. In the Russian aggression in Ukraine, China tries to act as an impartial player interested in a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

However, Chinese state propaganda media do not call the conflict the war and try to link its origins to the policies of the West in general and the United States in particular.

The decision to expel the aggressor country from the leading human rights platform is a significant diplomatic victory. It will exclude the possibility of using it for the legitimation of Russian narratives about the ""genocide in Donbas."" It is an abuse of the Council's cornerstones to have as a member a country that commits war crimes and wages aggressive war on a daily basis.

To increase pressure on Russia, the United States has imposed sanctions on 29 Russian companies, including the United Shipbuilding Corporation, which builds all warships, and one of the largest diamond mining companies, Alrosa (90% of diamond mining in Russia).

The United Kingdom has sanctioned both Putin’s and Lavrov's daughters.

Japan has begun to reduce imports of Russian coal, which accounts for 13% of energy generation. However, according to diplomatic sources, EU foreign ministers ""formally"" will not discuss the issue of blocking Russian oil imports at a meeting on Monday. Instead, additional restrictive measures and increased support for Ukraine should be expected.

Dmitry Medvedev described the sanctions as ""an act of aggression against Russia and a form of hybrid war."" Slovakia has handed over S-300 air defense systems to Ukraine, and Australia will supply 20 Bushmaster armored vehicles. However, the German Chancellor continues to delay the transfer of heavy armored vehicles to Ukraine.

Against the background of the regrouping of Russian invading forces and the escalation of the situation in eastern Ukraine, it is critical to adhere to the position set by the partner countries to support Ukraine with everything necessary for victory.

We have already passed the stage of ""too little, too late."" Still, we have not yet reached the pre-saturation of the means necessary for the liberation of the occupied territories and the imposition on Moscow conditions for a diplomatic settlement acceptable for Kyiv.

Relevant news in Russia:

Since yesterday, Russian Sberbank has not been making foreign currency transfers for its clients. The world's second-largest construction equipment manufacturer, the Japanese company Komatsu, is shutting down its plant in Russia. Caterpillar already made such a decision in early March.

Taiwanese manufacturer of computer equipment Acer temporarily ceased its activities in the territory of the Russian Federation. German food manufacturer Dr. Oetker leaves Russia. About 160 retail chains have temporarily suspended their activities in Russia.

Analysts calculated that in the event of their complete withdrawal, shopping centers would lose up to 70% of revenue. Moreover, they say that it will be challenging to find a replacement for brands. Companies from ""friendly"" countries are afraid of uncertainty, and Russian retailers will not be able to handle such volumes for several more years.

Informational Defence of Ukraine provides a daily review of the military-political situation in Ukraine as of April 7th, based on an analysis of open sources.

1. The Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions and continue counterattacks.

According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy's main efforts are focused on capturing Mariupol, conducting attacks near Izium and trying to break through the defence in the Donetsk direction.

In the Donetsk and Tavriia directions, the enemy continues to carry out fire and assault operations, launch missile and bomb strikes, and conduct artillery fire on the civilian infrastructure of settlements. The occupiers use the port of Berdiansk to transfer weapons, military equipment and personnel.

The enemies also intensified efforts in the Severodonetsk direction. They are trying to continue the attacks in the areas of Donetske, Novotoshkivske and Popasna. The enemy also tried to launch an attack in the areas of Mar’inka, Borivske and Solodke. Attempts to attack were unsuccessful.

The General Staff assumes that the occupiers will soon try to break through the defences of Ukrainian troops in the Severodonetskyi, Avdiyivskyi and Kurakhovskyi districts.

In the Pivdennyi Buh direction, the enemies conducted artillery fire, in some areas using army aircraft. They are trying to continue the attacks in the direction of Oleksandrivka.

In the Kharkiv region, up to five battalions of tactical groups of the enemy continue to encircle the city and fire at it from multiple rocket launchers, artillery and mortars.

The occupiers held Izium, trying to continue the attacks in the direction of Sloviansk and Barvinkove.

The total combat losses of the enemy from February 24 to April 7 were approximately: combatants - about 18,900 people, tanks - 698 units, armored combat vehicles - 1,891 units, artillery systems - 332 units, MLRS - 108 units, air defense - 55 units, aircraft - 150 units, helicopters - 135 units, cars - 1358 units, ships / boats - 7 units, fuel tanks - 76, UAVs of operational and tactical level - 111, special equipment - 25, TBM / BRBM (tactical ballistic missile / battlefield range ballistic missile) launchers - 4.

A group of SSOs of Ukraine seized several units of enemy air defence equipment during special operations. In particular, BPU complex BUK M1 and SAM BUK M2.

2. Information summaries and assessments of foreign and Ukrainian intelligence.

According to CNN, citing a US official, the United States believes it will be able to identify russian units that committed atrocities in Bucha. Identifying these is ""an extremely important priority right now"" for US intelligence agencies.

The collection and analysis of intelligence flows using all available tools and assets has been going on since the atrocities became known, and the United States is on the verge of narrowing the circle of suspects. According to officials, there is no certainty that the United States will publicly announce its conclusions, and a decision may be made to leave it to Ukraine.

US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin has officially confirmed that US intelligence is sharing the latest data with Ukrainian defenders, including russia's plans to seize Donetsk and Luhansk.

For the first time, a high-ranking US official like Austin [?] has publicly confirmed the exchange of classified government intelligence information between the United States and Ukraine.

3. Genocide of the Ukrainian people, shocking tragedy in Bucha – “Bucha massacre”.

According to DW, the Mayor of Bucha, Anatolii Fedoruk, said that the number of bodies found in the city was growing every day, and almost all of them had been shot dead: “As of last night (April 6), there were 320 civilians. The experts have been working with the found bodies (criminalists, militaries) [?] but the number is growing every day.

When asked by a journalist whether they died mainly due to shootings or artillery shelling, the mayor replied: “Almost 90% of the dead are the results of the bullets, not fragments.”

International community reacts to mass killings of Ukrainians in Bucha. In Berlin, Warsaw, Vilnius and Tbilisi mass rallies were held on Wednesday April 6th to commemorate Bucha residents brutally killed by russian soldiers.

Protesters lay on the ground with their hands tied behind their backs, symbolically showing their position and drawing the authorities' attention to atrocities committed by the russians in Bucha while the city was under occupation.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine responded to the latest statements of the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, with a call to “move to the right side of history.”

A spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Oleh Nikolenko, stressed that “after the elections in Budapest, we have a next stage - to help putin continue his aggression against Ukraine, the civilized world and Christian values”. [Dmytro, I’m not sure what he is trying to say here, but obviously Orban’s election victory makes Hungary’s stance towards the war in Ukraine more uncertain].

The reluctance of the Hungarian leadership to recognize russia's irrefutable responsibility for the atrocities in Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and other settlements means to consciously strengthen russia's sense of impunity and encourage it to commit new atrocities against Ukrainians,” Oleh Nikolenko said.

New evidence of the russian occupiers’ involvement in the mass killings of Ukrainians has been published. Federal Intelligence Service of Germany (BND, Bundesnachrichtendienst) has intercepted talks on radio communications between the russian military, in which the occupiers are discussing the massacre of civilians in Bucha.

In particular, the intelligence service has reports, the content of which coincide with the location of the bodies of killed civilians along the main street of Bucha. In one of them, a serviceman stated that he and his comrades shot a man on a bicycle. In another conversation, the man said that Ukrainian soldiers are first interrogated and then killed.

In addition, it can be concluded from these materials that Wagner's militants played a crucial role in the atrocities in Bucha, they demonstrated a special degree of brutality during their participation in the war in Syria.

Intercepted BND conversations suggest that the massacres in Bucha were neither accidental nor the actions of individual soldiers who lost their control. It is much more likely that the killing of civilians was a part of the russian military's usual manner of action, and possibly part of their strategy to spread fear among the civilian population and suppress resistance.

4. The russian occupiers continue to violate international humanitarian law.

The russian aggressors continue to kill Ukrainian children. More than 464 children were injured in Ukraine due to the armed aggression of the russian federation. As of the morning of April 7th, the official number of child victims fortunately has not changed - 167, the number of injured has increased - more than 297.

Most children were affected in the Kyiv (86), Donetsk (81), Kharkiv (73), Chernihiv (50), Mykolaiiv (39), Luhansk (32), Zaporizhzhia (22), Kherson (29), Sumy (16), Zhytomyr (15) regions and in Kyiv City (16).

On April 6th, the body of a 12-year-old girl who was burned in a car on a highway near the village of Yahidne in the Chernihiv region. During the temporary occupation of the Vyshhorod district of the Kyiv region in March, the russian occupiers fired on the civilian population of the village of Dymer. As a result of the shelling, a child was injured and her father died.

As a result of daily bombings and shelling, 928 educational institutions were damaged, of which 84 were completely destroyed.

The russian invaders continue to attack civilians daily. During the day, the enemy inflicted 48 strikes with MLRS, artillery, and mortars on the civilian infrastructure of Kharkiv, the regional state administration has informed.

During 43 days of the war, the russian occupiers did not leave a single hospital in the Luhansk region.

The russian occupiers are creating fake authorities. russians and their allies in Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia region, began to create fake authorities.

According to Energoatom in the Telegram: ""initially 34 members of the public council of self-organization of Enerhodar"" allegedly elected the main collaborator Shevchyk as the head of the “city administration”.

Then Shevchyk, by his own order, ""single-handedly"" fired the legally elected mayor, Dmytro Orlov, and “at the same time all the heads and members of the executive bodies of the city authorities. Well, he signed a note to fire everyone.”

In Melitopol, russian occupiers and collaborators have already abducted more than 100 people.

5. The evacuation of civilians under the attacks of the russian aggressors continues.

On Wednesday April 6th, with the help of the humanitarian corridors from Mariupol and Berdiansk, 3,686 people travelled in their own transport and by evacuation buses to Zaporizhzhia. 1,171 of them are from Mariupol. 2,515 people arrived from the cities of the Zaporizhzhia region: Polohy, Vasylivka, Berdiansk, Melitopol and Huliaipole.

In the Luhansk region, 1,206 people were evacuated from Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna and the village of Hirske on Wednesday.

The enemy made an air strike on the overpass near the Barvinkove station on the Donetsk railway. This is the only Ukrainian-controlled railway exit from cities such as Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Lyman. Three evacuation trains remained temporarily blocked in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.

6. International support and assistance to Ukraine.

Political support for Ukraine and security guarantees. According to Politico, the US Senate has unanimously passed an important bill to restore the program of World War II, which will allow President Joe Biden to send more effective weapons and other supplies to Ukraine against russia's invasion.

The document, known as the Law on Land Lease for the Defense of Ukraine's Democracy of 2022, will speed up the transfer of important military equipment and other critical supplies to Ukraine by reducing bureaucratic red tape. It allows de facto donations of equipment with provisions that provide that the recipient countries will pay their value to the United States later.

Military assistance to Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with NBC that all scenarios of war with Russia would have a victory for Ukraine in the end.

He stressed information about the additional supply of weapons to Ukraine: “The President allowed us to use another $100 million to provide more Javelin to our Ukrainian partners… For each russian tank in Ukraine we have provided or will soon provide 10 anti-tank systems.”

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has said that the Ukrainian military has been trained in the United States and can share experience in the Armed Forces in the use of kamikaze drones called Switchblades.

John Kirby has noted that Ukrainians will soon return home where they could transfer their knowledge and skills to their colleagues.

The UK Ministry of Defence is considering options for sending armoured vehicles such as Mastiff, as well as vehicles like the Chakal, which can be used as reconnaissance or long-range patrol.

Financial assistance to Ukraine. According to Minister of Finance, Serhii Marchenko, the country has already received about three billion euros in financial assistance from the partners. “Today we are negotiating for approximately 7 billion euros, of which we have already received about 3 billion euros,” Marchenko said.

The Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the German State Bank Credit Institution for Reconstruction (KfW) signed a loan agreement worth 150 million euros.

Loans are provided under the project “IHR-Financing Covid-19” and will be directed to the state budget to refinance the costs incurred under the state programs: “Affordable Loans 5-7-9%” and “Affordable Financial Leasing 5-7-9%”.

Humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The United States Government Agency for International Development (USAID) helps to finance and deliver 5,000 sets of equipment for satellite Internet Starlink of Elon Musk’s company StarXink's to Ukraine.

According to Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi a container town is being set up in Lviv where 350 temporary migrants evacuated from hotspots will be able to live.

The mayor of Lviv explained that these houses were donated from the Polish government. First of all, the students of universities evacuated from hotspots will settle there.

The first seven resuscitation vehicles donated to the Ukrainians from Munich arrived in Kyiv. This was announced by Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko on his Facebook page.

7. Provocations and fakes of the russian aggressors.

Sergei Naryshkin, director of the russian Foreign Intelligence Service, wrote an article claiming that American political technologists set NATO the task of prolonging the war in Ukraine as much as possible in order to turn it into a model of Afghanistan for russia.

According to him, the most insidious methods are used for this, up to the exile of armed militants to Ukrainian territory, who are tasked with organizing and supporting the so-called partisan, and, in fact, terrorists in the country.

Naryshkin notes that the United States and the vast majority of NATO countries are not ready to enter into direct armed confrontation with russia, preferring to limit themselves to providing moral and material support to Kyiv.

Naryshkin asserts that russia is allegedly trying to prevent “Ukraine's transformation into a puppet Russophobic state, which is trying to form its own identity on the basis of denial and demonization of everything that naturally connects it with russia.”

According to him, the persistence of the ""conflict"" in Ukraine shows that not only the fate of the ""Kyiv regime"" is at stake, but also the ""architecture of the whole world order.”

""Predicting its specific contours, based on the current situation, is quite difficult, there will be no return to the old world,"" wrote the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service.

8. Political and socio-economic situation in russia, the impact of international sanctions on it.

General Assembly supported the resolution on the suspension of the russian federation's membership in the UN Human Rights Council. The reason for the resolution was gross human rights violations in Bucha in the Kyiv region.

Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations, Serhii Kyslytsia, published the results of the vote - 93 ""for"", 24 ""against"", and 58 ""abstained"".

In addition to russia, Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, Nicaragua, Algeria, Bolivia, Burundi, Gabon, the Central Africa Republic, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Zimbabwe and Vietnam have voted against suspending its membership in the Human Rights Council.

Among the 58 states that have abstained are India, Brazil, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.

NATO countries do not have a single strategy for russia. According to The New York Times , having been faced with the prospect of a long and gruelling war in Ukraine, NATO countries disagree on how best to proceed.

Central European countries, such as Poland and the Baltic countries, want a complete break with Moscow and attempts to bring russia to its knees. They worry that russia can present anything as its victory and will continue to cause serious damage to European security.

Other countries believe that russia cannot be easily conquered and that the outcome of the war is likely to be chaotic - more likely to end in an eventual ceasefire after a long and gruelling conflict than a resounding victory. According to officials, countries such as France, Germany and Turkey want to maintain contact with russian president putin, despite allegations of war crimes committed by his troops.

NATO foreign ministers who have met this week to discuss how to help Ukraine agree on one important issue: the war is far from over and war crimes will continue despite the withdrawal of russian troops from northern Ukraine.

As noted, even if the war ends with a new line of contact between russian and Ukrainian forces, NATO seeks to work with Kyiv to make Ukraine indigestible to russia.

EU ambassadors at a meeting on Wednesday failed to decide on a fifth package of sanctions against russia. According to Ceske Noviny, citing diplomatic sources, some countries have called for clarification on the proposed embargo on russian coal imports and a ban on mooring russian ships in EU ports.

According to diplomats, the Commission should indicate, in particular, whether the ban should apply to existing coal contracts or only new ones. He said that some countries, led by Germany, wanted to define more clearly the conditions under which the EU should cut itself off from russian coal supplies forever.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has backed an embargo on russian oil and gas imports. He stated this at a press conference after the government meeting.

Mario Draghi described the EU's debate on a possible ban on russian gas imports: “What do we choose: housing or air conditioning? We have to ask ourselves this question.”

The Estonian government has agreed to stop importing russian gas into the country by the end of 2022, and to compensate for these supplies through a leased LNG terminal.

In order to reduce dependence on russian oil, the Allies are releasing their strategic oil reserves. As The Wall Street Journal and Reuters write, citing other sources, 29 countries that are members of the International Energy Agency are ready to release 120 million barrels of oil from their strategic reserves.

This is the largest oil intervention in the history of the IEA. According to sources, 60 million barrels will be allocated by the United States, another 60 million by the rest of the IEA (the organization includes 31 countries, including most European countries, Australia and Japan).

In addition, the United States last week said they were ready to withdraw 1 million barrels of oil per day from its strategic reserve for six months, or about 180 million barrels.

New sanctions and restrictions are being imposed on russia, which is having a negative impact on the russian economy. Australia is imposing financial sanctions and a travel ban on another 67 russians in connection with the russian invasion of Ukraine, bringing the total number of individuals and organizations affected by the sanctions to almost 600.

The United States has imposed sanctions on putin's daughters, Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova, about whom the russian president has never spoken publicly.

Switzerland has so far blocked 7.5 billion Swiss francs ($ 8 billion) in russian assets after first imposing sanctions on people close to the kremlin.

According to the results of 2022, unemployment in russia may more than double and exceed 9% for the first time in 10 years. According to experts, about 2 million jobs are at risk. This was reported by Bloomberg with reference to a March poll of analysts.

Inflation in russia accelerated to 16.7% year on year by April 1st. Prices for products by April 1 increased by 9.9%.

Belgium has blocked transactions worth more than 196 billion euros under EU sanctions against russia.

Streaming service Spotify after April 11th will completely stop working in russia - this means that you can no longer use the services on the site and in the application.

According to Bloomberg, some Chinese importers have switched to importing russian coal and oil in Chinese Yuan. Several Chinese companies used local currency to buy russian coal in March to get it in April. The russian oil sellers also offered Chinese buyers the opportunity to pay in Chinese Yuan.

The UK company GlaxoSmithKline has said that its consumer division has stopped importing food supplements and vitamins to russia.",https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/822269.html
