The French president said EU leaders would meet to discuss plans to pool military resources on March 10 at a summit in Versailles.

Mr Macron supports the creation of an EU army and the plans could lay the groundwork for that force in the future. He has called on the EU to make itself able to act independently of the US and Nato.

Europe had to accept it must “pay the price for peace,” Mr Macron, who condemned Mr Putin’s “lies”, said.

“We cannot let others defend ourselves; whether on land, at sea, under the sea, in the air, in space or in cyberspace,” Mr Macron said in a televised speech on Wednesday night.

He added “Our European defence must take a new step”.

Plans for a 5,000 strong EU rapid response force, which could be deployed to crisis zones around the world are expected to be discussed at the defence summit.

Measures to boost interoperability between national militaries, increase pooled research funding, and defence spending initiatives favouring European companies are also likely to be on the table.

The French President has long pushed for a collective EU army, saying back in 2018 that European citizens could not be fully protected without a “true, European army”. The UK has always gone up against such plans, even prior to the Brexit vote.

Along with a number of the Baltic states, the UK has argued that an EU army could undermine the efficiency - and infringe on the jurisdiction - of NATO. Speaking on French national television on Wednesday night, Mr Macron said the Russian invasion had changed the terrain, and the arguments, for a so-called EU army. He said: “We cannot let others defend ourselves; whether on land, at sea, under the sea, in the air, in space or in cyberspace.” Adding that “our European defence must take a new step”, the French President, and current EU rotating president, said Europe must “pay the price for peace”.

An EU-wide military force would act outside the constraints of the US or NATO. Mr Macron said EU leaders would use a summit at Versailles next week to discuss how the bloc could pool collective military resources. This defence summit on March 10 will be used to discuss how the EU could formulate a force of 5,000 soldiers, which could be deployed at short notice across the world. Mr Macron added that the war in Ukraine had “changed the era”, and the EU must react to such “unprecedented change”. READ MORE: Turkey: Erdogan power play over Putin

France is the most formidable military power still in the EU after the UK left the bloc, and pushing the agenda of a common defence force has been one expected of Macron and the French rotating presidency. With lacklustre support across the bloc, the plans have always stalled at the discussion phase. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine has seen a policy U-turn from a number of states, not least for Europe’s largest economy, Germany. New Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced that for the first time in years, Germany would reach the defence target set by NATO of two percent of a member state’s GDP.

But when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed a parliamentary session via video link on Tuesday, something extraordinary happened: the person relaying his words into English was so moved that he audibly fought to hold back his tears. “We’re fighting … just for our land … and for our freedom,” he said, then sniffed, his voice almost breaking as Zelenskiy, wearing a khaki T-shirt in what looked like a bunker, declared: “Despite the fact … that all our cities of our country are now blocked … nobody is going to enter and intervene with the freedom and our country.”

This is just one example among many, of how Vladimir Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine is shaking Europeans to the core. Having long believed that war was impossible on the continent, they are shocked – and embarrassed – that Ukrainians must not only defend their country against Russian aggression, but must also defend democracy, freedom and the right of sovereign states to determine their destiny – the very principles that underpin the European Union.

This war reinforces, with a jolt, the very raison d’etre of the EU as a peace project. After 24 February, no one will again be able to say that the EU’s founding credo, “Never again”, is outdated, and that the EU needs a new narrative to help younger generations – who have no memory of war – relate to European integration.

This is why the 27 member states, notoriously divided and slow when it comes to decision-making in Brussels, are showing such remarkable resolve today – especially over foreign policy and defence, which they traditionally prefer to keep national. In the past week, they have cut off Russian banks from the Swift payment system, financed the procurement of weapons to send to Ukraine (ironically from a fund called the European Peace Facility), blocked the Russian propaganda channels RT and Sputnik, and closed European skies for aircraft to and from Russia. Parliament even applauded the idea of Ukrainian membership of the EU, although most member states remain sceptical, because this process takes years.

Fuelled by emotion, the European train is rolling so fast that some are cautioning restraint in the face of Putin’s threat of nuclear escalation – emphasising that the US and European countries will not directly fight in Ukraine.

Yet the need for a strong territorial defence now tops the agenda – not just in Germany, which just doubled its defence budget for 2022, but even in militarily neutral Finland and Sweden, which are sending weapons to Ukraine. Neither of these Nordic EU members is in Nato, although both are closely collaborating with it. Public support for Nato membership is markedly growing. In Austria, where anti-Americanism is rife, similar discussions are taking place. A former ambassador to Moscow told public radio that Austrians are suddenly discovering that “Nato is our security”, adding, Das sind neue Zeiten (“This is a new era”).

Putin’s war is now dominating EU debates on a range of other policies. After 15 years of talking, Brussels suddenly agreed to connect Ukraine and Moldova (feared to be next on Putin’s hitlist) to the European electricity grid. EU agriculture ministers have discussed extra supplies of wheat, food and fertiliser to countries that depend on shipments from Ukraine. Even eurozone monetary policies will change. No country will be punished for budget deficits and, with the increasing weaponisation of the world’s reserve currencies, eurozone membership will become more than a form of protection against exchange rate upheavals or a way to foster intra-EU trade – it will be a geopolitical insurance policy. Under these circumstances, Dutch-German resistance to common borrowing (Eurobonds) could melt away.

Poland and Hungary, until now unwilling to welcome refugees, have suddenly opened border crossings to – admittedly –white, Christian ones. Polish workers in Belgium jump in their cars and drive east to help out as Ukrainians flee the fighting. A week of Russian bombardment has driven more than a million people from Ukraine into neighbouring countries of the EU. The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, expects another 4 to 5 million to come In 2015, the arrival of a million Syrian refugees led to political turmoil across Europe; now there is no panic at all. Rather, according to Hugo Brady of the International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Vienna: “Eastern European countries are having their Wir schaffen das moment”.

The German-French writer and political scientist Alfred Grosser wrote in Wie anders sind die Deutschen (How Different Are the Germans?) that Joseph Stalin deserved the first Charlemagne prize for services to European integration, for without the shared, transatlantic fear of communist totalitarianism, “there would never have been a [European] community”.

Fear of Putin now has a similar function. It brings the US and Europe closer together, mutes internal discord in the EU for now, and makes clear that Nato is not, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, once suggested, “brain-dead” but Europe’s ultimate guarantor of peace.

Putin’s invasion “appears to be pushing the EU to centralise more rapidly than before in its history”, Kathleen McNamara and Daniel Kelemen, professors of Georgetown and Rutgers university respectively, argued in the Washington Post this week. For the moment, this is very much the dynamic. Undoubtedly, divisions between EU member states will reappear soon. They always do. And, as always, the EU will deal with them – this is why it was set up in the first place.

But one thing is sure: because of Putin’s war, Europeans have discovered that “Never again” is here again.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/mar/03/vladimir-putin-war-eu-ukraine-european-project

All EU countries need to take a long, hard look at their past mistakes - but it is Berlin and Paris in particular that need some serious self-reflection should they ever aspire to be taken seriously again as the de facto leaders of Europe. And as Russia continues to wage war in Europe, Germany and France, together with the rest of the EU, will not only be judged for their past failures, but also on what they do next to stop Putin.

To be clear, the Kremlin started the war in Ukraine. Putin should be tried and punished for the war crimes he has committed. However, his growing sense of power and impunity has been enabled by weak, naïve and short-sighted Western leaders, whose actions have been guided by complacency, ignorance and greed.

The US, under both the Obama and Trump administrations; the UK with its catering to oligarchs; and EU member states from Finland to Hungary and from Italy to Malta, have let Russia play them. But the main culprit in the EU for letting Moscow rule and divide and enabling the war in Ukraine is Germany, supported by a naïve and hapless France.

For years, the EU has been undermining its economic and political power from within. Its member states have let a country highly dependent on exports to the EU, with a GDP the size of Italy, define the rules of the game. Despite all the warnings – the 2006 and 2009 gas crises, the 2008 invasion of Georgia, Russian bombs in Syria, the annexation of Crimea, or the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 killing 298 people in 2014 – the EU, under the leadership of Germany and France, continued to push for diplomatic niceties with Russia, prioritised their commercial links and at best, managed to utter soft condemnations of some sort or impose sanctions without any real impact.

Sleepwalking

It is now blatantly evident that the EU has been sleepwalking for more than a decade. It has enabled Russian aggression and, ultimately, the unjustified war against Ukraine. The Union’s actions – and inaction – guided by Germany and France have endangered the future of the entire European continent. The level of incompetence, short-sightedness, greed and corruption that has driven them, and other EU member states, is flabbergasting.

For years, the Baltic states, Poland and others have sounded the alarm bell about Putin's Russia, only to be labelled revanchist and paranoid by the French and Germans. Ukraine’s cries for help have fallen on deaf ears. Driven by arrogance and astonishing naivety, they ignored those that knew better, those that had actually been in the room with the Russians, as partners of the Soviet Union or members of the Warsaw Pact, for more than four decades.

The French and the Germans ignored the voices of those who better understood the motives and delusions of the Russian establishment – and how to manage them, be it via the EU’s foreign policy or energy transition.

While Germany and France have not been the only ones enabling Putin’s growing aggression, they hold a special responsibility for having failed to take measures that would have been expected from ‘leaders’ in the EU. In this light, the role of politicians from the German and French establishment – from former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to former French Prime Minister Francois Fillon – as strong advocates of Russian interests should not go unnoticed.

Moreover, we should not forget France’s and Germany’s keenness to earn revenue by selling military technologies to Russia rather than think through the strategic – and tragic – consequences of their sales.

Discussions around energy security provide a sad demonstration of how big speeches in the EU have led to very little action under German and French “leadership”. Back in 2014, following the Russian invasion of Crimea, there was no shortage of talk in the union on what should be done to reduce the member states’ energy dependency on Russia.

It was crystal clear that the EU and its members could not continue to rely on Russia for energy and that they had to increase their energy security, not just by diversifying sources and routes for gas, but especially by improving energy efficiency and the uptake of renewables.

The opposite happened. The EU’s share of imports of gas and coal from Russia increased_v2.png), and the country has also remained an important source of oil. Germany’s thirst for Russian hydrocarbons, driven by the Energiewende and manifested in its forceful push for the Nord Stream2 gas pipeline - which raised serious geopolitical, political, climate and energy security concerns across the EU since it was launched – undermined not only Germany’s but the whole of the EU’s (energy) security.

And while Germany spearheaded the exercise, French gas utility company Engie was a partner in Nord Stream2 and Paris repeatedly declared it did not want to ""meddle in German choices"". This contributed to the Union’s failure to implement agreed measures to improve its energy security, reduce its vulnerability towards Russia and use its economic power to pressure Moscow.

This gap between member states’ rhetoric statements and actions has undermined the Union for decades. EU countries – led by Germany and France – have tended to implement common goals and agreements selectively, when it has suited their national interests. The union’s failure to act as one and to implement agreed measures has now culminated in what the EU was created to avoid: another war in Europe. The price is now being paid by Europe as a whole.

Darkest hour

Fast-forward to last week, to the darkest hour the European continent has witnessed in 75 years. Germany and France, supported by Italy, initially lost their moral compass. When a fellow European democracy was attacked by a lunatic autocrat, Germany initially not only failed to provide assistance in the form of military equipment; it actively prevented other EU member states from doing so.

And when the capital of Kyiv was bombarded and encircled, France and Germany, again supported by Italy, were advocating a step-wise approach to the application of sanctions, dictated by the commercial interests of a few enterprises. After decades of rhetoric on European values and principles, when push came to shove, for these self-proclaimed leaders of the EU, they seemed to count for nothing.

The corrective action taken by the EU27 in the few last days shows that the EU, Germany and France have learned their lesson the hard way. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has united the EU27 like never before. The member states are realising that they are stronger when they act together. The last week has seen one impossible feat after another become possible, from tough sanctions to the EU buying weapons and cutting Russia off from SWIFT.

But for Ukrainians, this realisation comes tragically late. They and the rest of Europe are now paying the price for Western complacency, applied in particular by Germany and France for years. Critical time was lost, avoidable human suffering not avoided. In view of Russia’s reliance on European fossil fuel imports for its economy, it is the member states’ thirst for Russian gas, oil and coal that has enabled and financed the Russian war machine and the war in Ukraine.

The EU, led by Germany and France, will not only be judged for not taking the necessary measures to counter Putin’s growing aggression in the last decade but also on the steps they take next. They should do the obvious: stop sponsoring the Russian war machine. The sanctions and military assistance to Ukraine today will be of little comfort if the EU member states simultaneously continue to finance the Russian war machine with their fossil fuel imports. This must stop with immediate effect.

The next days, weeks and months will be a true test for the EU as a whole, including for Germany and France. Leadership comes with responsibility. The EU needs leadership that will actually lead and does what it takes to stop Putin's aggression, ensure solidarity across the EU amidst sanctions and flows of refugees, and convince Europeans to accept that exceptional times call for exceptional measures.

Earlier, parliamentarians had stood at their desks applauding Ukraine and wearing blue and yellow flags. Outside the parliament, Ukrainians and their supporters maintained a noisy vigil.

Sat at a table wearing a t-shirt, Zelenskyy’s speech was so moving that even the parliament's translator was choked with tears. After a debate, MEPs were then asked to vote on a resolution that called on Russia to cease the violence and condemned the war Vladimir Putin had started.

A massive majority - 637 MEPs - from the far left to the far right, from Romania to Portugal to Finland, united and voted yes.

Mick Wallace voted no.

“Much of the resolution is important and necessary,” Wallace told Euronews on Wednesday.

“It correctly condemns Russian aggression and calls for humanitarian support for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees. These are terms we wholeheartedly support.”

But much of it, Wallace said, was not. It called for the strengthening of NATO’s forward military presence, a dramatic increase in defence spending and the strengthening of the European pillar within NATO. It calls for the replacement of Russian with American oil, extracted through fracking.

“We sought to remove these elements from the resolution, but the majority in the European Parliament has voted to keep them. We are now asked to vote on the text as a whole, which includes these provisions. We are opposed to war, and we are opposed to this resolution.”

Wallace wasn’t alone in opposing the resolution on Tuesday, six others from the parliament’s Left group also voted no: Clare Daly, Özlem Demirel, Sandra Pereira, João Pimenta Lopes, Martin Schirdewan, Miguel Urban Crespo.

But equally, it was not a party platform, French MEP Manon Aubry, and co-chair of the Left, was one of the sponsors of the bill.

Aubry told Euronews that six amendments to the bill that ""significantly improved the text"", including adding the call for an immediate ceasefire, greater involvement for the United Nations and OSCE and calling for refugees to be welcomed, were added after an intervention from the Left.

""I co-signed the initial text and voted the final text as co-chair of the group because I wanted to send a clear political message denouncing Putin's irresponsible aggression and supporting the Ukrainian people,"" she said.

""Other delegations decided to abstain or vote against the text because they wanted to insist on the risk of a global war on the continent if the EU enters the vicious circle of military escalation.""

Irish MEP Daly said she voted against the resolution because it calls for increasing weapons supply to Ukraine, something that will “only make the situation worse”.

""The only way in which the conflict can be ended is through peace talks and negotiation. Throwing in more weapons into the situation simply puts petrol on the fire,” Daly told Euronews.

“It is really regrettable that NATO and the US and the EU are not supporting the idea of an internationally brokered peace agreement. This is the only solution. Ironically it is only the Chinese putting this forward now, but this is the only way.”

German MEP Demirel also told Euronews that the resolution would only “pour oil on the fire” of the conflict, and accused European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen of using the situation - including Zelenskyy’s speech - of an excuse to push forward a wider agenda: transforming the EU “into a tangible and powerful military union,” she said.

“I think it is cynical to abuse the suffering of the Ukrainians for something like this. The peoples in Ukraine, of Europe and the world want to live in peace and social security.”

Spanish MEP Crespo said that while he “totally condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine”, the resolution would only escalate the situation. “Faced with two giants putting on the table more and more weapons, more missiles and beginning to threaten with nuclear weapons, the only way out is to demand to go all the ways to peace. Otherwise, it will only lead to death and destruction,” he said.

Schirdewan responded through a spokesperson with a statement by the German Die Linke delegation, which said that although it condemned Russia's invasions as a ""blatant breach of international law"", it was against sending arms to Ukraine.

""The intended delivery of lethal equipment to the Ukrainian army worth 450 million euros ultimately means the final departure from the common position of the EU arms export directives, which prohibit arms exports to war and crisis zones. These arms exports are a breach of taboo in European foreign policy,"" it said.

'An imperialist war'

Some who were against the resolution, however, went further.

In a statement, two of the non-aligned members of the parliament who voted no, Kostas Papadakis and Lefteris Nikolaou-Alavanos said that the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) condemned ""the imperialist war, which is the result of the imperialist competition for spheres of influence and wealth-producing resources that the resolution enhances, as it is moving in the dangerous direction of escalating the imperialist competition with EU-NATO military equipment and sanctions.

""Condemning capitalist Russia's invasion of Ukraine is combined with condemning the US-NATO-EU war crimes against the peoples of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya. Peoples should not choose an imperialist.""

Lopes and Pereira, who responded to Euronews through a spokesperson, echoed that view.

In their statement, the Portuguese Communist Party members accused the European Union and NATO of supporting a coup d'etat in Ukraine in 2014, described the Russian invasion as a “military intervention” and echoed the Kremlin’s line that Ukraine was controlled by fascist forces. It accused NATO and the EU - although, notably, not Moscow - of “war-mongering”.

Wallace, meanwhile, told Euronews that his voting record on the issue to be misrepresented, and while he voted against the resolution, he and fellow Irish MEP Daly had consistently condemned war, wherever it was.

""We will continue to oppose both Russian aggression and the militarisation of Europe, which are not in the interests of Ukrainians, Russians, Europeans, or anyone else,"" he said.",https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/03/02/meps-were-asked-to-condemn-russia-s-invasion-of-ukraine-13-voted-no-here-s-why
7,e4514ce4-ddb0-4886-9bbf-7993fc08a8ea,"['Sebastian Sprenger', 'Joe Gould', 'Vivienne Machi', 'Tom Kington']",2022-03-04 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — Western nations are beginning to channel the shock over Russia’s military assault on Ukraine into a wholesale remake of their defense policies, deepening alliances and swelling budgets.

The dynamics of the conflict have shifted in recent days as Moscow’s forces gain the upper hand in some areas by their sheer overmatch in firepower, according to analysts. The humanitarian catastrophe caused by the destruction has left Ukrainian leaders pleading for more military help, a request NATO officials have said they can accommodate only indirectly and, increasingly, discreetly.

With no end game in sight for the conflict, governments on both sides of the Atlantic are beginning to settle in for the long haul.

U.S. President Joe Biden, in a March 2 address, seemed to be preparing the country for a lengthy period of tension, and the likelihood that Ukrainian forces may not hold out for much longer against Russia’s conventional military might.

“[Russian President Vladimir] Putin has unleashed violence and chaos,” Biden said. “But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.”

Some European nations are now waking up to the fact that Russia is willing to use military force to redraw borders in their neighborhood, an idea still pooh-poohed in Western European circles even after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

The continent’s defense scenario is shifting daily, said Alessandro Marrone, a defense analyst at the Rome-based think tank IAI.

“A number of historical thresholds have been passed in recent weeks. The war in Ukraine will not be short, Germany’s budget hike will have a huge impact on German and Europe’s industry. And the [European Union’s] €500 million [(U.S. $547 million)] spending on weapons for the war is a watershed in the relations with Russia,” Marrone said.

‘A significant moment’

Heather Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said nations should quickly move past the realization the world’s security order has irreversibly shifted.

“Now we lean in with our allies and partners to make sure there’s no rollback, to make sure they implement and they execute that,” the think tank’s leader said. “It’s such a significant moment, but we can’t bask in that moment; we have to lean in and get greater purpose and focus.”

Discussions have already begun in Germany about the practical implications of a defense budget that Chancellor Olaf Scholz said would rise beyond 2% of gross domestic product, propped up by a $113 billion special fund to be disbursed over several years. NATO has set a target for its members to spend 2% of their respective GDP on defense.

Analysis by the Berlin-based German Council on Foreign Relations found the extra money would yield “no champagne,” but only fill “empty water glasses.” The think tank said the backlog of underfunding Germany’s military amounts to €90 billion over the past 30 years, according to slides posted on Twitter by analyst Christian Mölling.

Once lawmakers approve the spending uptick, it remains to be seen if the German defense bureaucracy and its associated industries can actually convert the money into better readiness and modernized equipment.

In the United States, the discussion is similarly moving toward the question of how big future defense increases will be — not whether there will be one at all.

The next U.S. defense budget will now “have to be bigger than we thought,” according to Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and is typically a skeptic of enlarged Defense Department budgets. He said Capitol Hill is gripped by a new spirit of bipartisan cooperation to tackle the crisis.

“Just the Russian invasion in Ukraine fundamentally altered what our national security posture, what our defense posture needs to be,” Smith said at an American Enterprise Institute event March 3. “It made it more complicated, and it made it more expensive. … The decision to invade Ukraine by Russia changes it, and it’s going to go up. There’s no doubt about it.”

While some leading Republicans are calling on Biden to pursue a defense budget increase for fiscal 2023 that exceeds inflation by 5%, Congress is meanwhile considering Biden’s request for an immediate $10 billion in Ukraine-focused defense and humanitarian spending. That’s likely to be tacked onto a still-missing budget deal for FY22.

A hint to where new dollars could flow: Smith’s Republican counterpart, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, has encouraged Romania and the U.S. to cut a deal for American troops to be permanently stationed in the European country, and Pentagon officials acknowledge they must now revisit four-month-old force posture plans to consider the possibility of new permanent or rotational troop deployments to NATO nations in Eastern Europe.

“Posture-wise, yes, we’re going to need to do more in Eastern Europe,” Smith said. “I don’t think we can forget about Asia because the presence does matter. So I think we’re going to need to balance those two things.”

Analysts and politicians have said Putin’s war on Ukraine has galvanized the West like no event before. Germany’s dramatic policy change on Russia is only the tip of the iceberg, as other nations previously hesitant about confronting Moscow realize the Kremlin cannot be acquiesced.

Italy and France

After years of lukewarm support for Russian sanctions, partly inspired by strong business ties with Moscow, Italy has done an about-face under the guidance of Prime Minister Mario Draghi and thrown its weight behind moves to punish Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.

Rome has joined other European nations in sending Stinger missiles and other weaponry to Kyiv, a move backed by politicians who previously voiced admiration for Russia.

The change in viewpoint on Russia means Italy’s political class is catching up with the country’s military chiefs, who have been preparing for a high-end conflict in recent years.

“Ukraine has had a huge impact on the political level, which will give a political impetus to implement capability development, which is already being largely planned,” said Marrone, the Italian defense analyst.

“New submarines, corvettes and the [short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing] F-35 will help ensure maritime security, which will be strained in the Mediterranean,” he said. “Italy is also investing in new wheeled armored vehicles, although it has to decide on a next-generation main battle tank, also depending whether the French-German development will open to third parties.”

Marrone does not expect a new iron curtain to descend on Europe, separating east from west. “Ukraine may remain in a kind of limbo, a place where conflict could flare up at any time,” he said.

In France, where presidential elections are up next month, the nation’s foreign policy agenda and its approach to Russia are more relevant than ever before. All nine declared candidates have joined Macron in condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although they differ in assigning responsibility, analysts Mathilde Ciulla and Amandine Drouet noted in a March 1 report for the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Macron, who has long supported robust French defense spending and advocated for European strategic autonomy, formally announced his decision to run for reelection on Thursday. He is currently leading the polls to win a second term.

Geopolitical issues remain low on the list of French citizens’ concerns, but the presidential campaign debate will allow the candidates to transform a foreign policy debate into a domestic one by presenting their views on different regimes, democracy and rule of law, Ciulla and Drouet wrote in an email to Defense News.

“The invasion has forced candidates to clarify their position on Russia, and to give elements of what their diplomacy towards this neighbor would be, should they be elected president,” they said.

France has sent helmets, bulletproof vests, demining equipment and first aid kits to Ukraine, per Armed Forces Ministry spokesman Herve Grandjean.

More defensive equipment is on the way, but the French government will not comment on what it is, citing security reasons, Grandjean told reporters Thursday. He also would not say whether the European Union’s plan to provide €500 million worth of lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine would include French-made weapons.

Elysee officials told reporters that Putin expressed ""his great determination"" to continue his military offensive with the objective ""to take complete control of Ukraine,"" said a report by BFMTV news.

The 90-minute exchange initiated by the Russian head of state failed to yield any assurance from Russia to slow the military offensive even as new talks between Moscow and Kyiv began on the Belarusian-Polish border late Thursday.

Putin also threatened to increase his demands with Kyiv to achieve Moscow's objective of demilitarization and a neutral status for Ukraine, the report said.

Macron reportedly told Putin he was ""lying to himself"" and making a ""major mistake"" by choosing to continue the war as it will result in international sanctions which would weaken and isolate Moscow for a very long time.

But Putin told Macron that the Russian army's operations were developing ""according to the plan"" and they would ""get worse"" if the Ukrainians did not accept its conditions, according to another report by French newspaper Le Monde.

Macron afterward shared details about the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian evoked sentiments similar to Macron's earlier when he said the worst is yet to come as major Ukrainian cities are at risk of falling under the Russian siege.",https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/macron-fears-worst-is-yet-to-come-on-russia-ukraine-war

Far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour have long expressed admiration for the Russian President, whose nationalist screeds and bombings in Syria have informed their own anti-immigration and anti-terrorism diatribes. They are both paying for it now.

The hashtags #VladimirZemmour and #MarinePoutine (in French, the Russian President shares his name with that of the Quebec junk food) have been trending on social media, thanks to an avalanche of attacks by supporters of Valérie Pécresse, the presidential candidate for the centre-right Les Républicains. Her campaign team coined the devastating hashtags.

The deadline has now passed for presidential candidates to file their papers, including the signatures of at least 500 sponsors from a list of 42,000 elected-office holders, and the 35-day campaign in advance of the first-ballot vote on April 10 is shaping up to be unlike any other since the introduction of direct suffrage in 1962. And no candidate stands to benefit from this as much as Mr. Macron.

With a bloody war raging in Europe, the electoral battleground has suddenly shifted from the domestic domain to the continental sphere. The future of Europe is on the ballot in direct and tangible ways. The debate now revolves not around abstract concepts about the division of power in the European Union, but around which candidate can stand up to Russia’s aggression.

This is a problem for Ms. Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, whose party remains deeply in debt to the Russian banks that financed her 2017 presidential bid. She trekked to Moscow during that campaign for a Kremlin meeting with the Russian President, where she thanked Mr. Putin for his military intervention against “terrorists” in Syria and expressed her opposition to European sanctions slapped on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea. She said then that her “point of view on Ukraine coincides with that of Russia.”

The Paris-based daily paper Libération reported this week that Ms. Le Pen’s party had been forced to dump 1.2 million copies of a campaign pamphlet prepared for the beginning of the official campaign because the tract contained a photo of Ms. Le Pen shaking hands with Mr. Putin.

The National Rally leader, who has for weeks been in a tight three-way race with Mr. Zemmour and Ms. Pécresse to finish second behind Mr. Macron on the first ballot, did this week condemn Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and agreed France should accept Ukrainian migrants displaced by the war. Mr. Zemmour, who has long favoured closing France’s borders, has opposed taking in Ukrainian refugees, saying it is “not good to tear people like that so far from their country.”

The anti-capitalist far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a long-time apologist for Mr. Putin’s crusade against NATO expansionism, has also been on the defensive since Russian troops moved into Ukraine. His Socialist rival, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, whose campaign has foundered, this week accused Mr. Mélenchon of being an “agent” who serves “Mr. Putin’s interests.”

Theoretically, the incriminating histories of Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Zemmour and Mr. Mélenchon should boost the efforts of Ms. Pécresse, who has struggled to make an impression since winning her party’s presidential nomination in December, to corral the anti-Macron vote. At a rally last weekend near the site of the D-Day landing in Normandy, she promised to make France a “spearhead for the resistance and the combat for democracy” in the face of Mr. Putin’s war. But it will be hard for her to compete with Mr. Macron in that department.

On Wednesday night, Mr. Macron delivered a televised address from the Élysée Palace aimed in part at reminding French voters that the job he currently holds is not one for imposters.

“War in Europe is no longer confined to our history books or our school manuals; it is here before our eyes,” he said. “This war is the fruit of a revenge mindset, nourished by a revisionist history of Europe, that seeks to return it to the darkest hours of empires, invasions and exterminations.”

Mr. Macron, who spoke to Mr. Putin for more than an hour on Thursday, has positioned himself as Europe’s indispensable head of state – the only one truly capable of mediating between the Russian President and his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, and of preventing a bad situation from getting worse. His approval rating has skyrocketed in recent days to its highest level since his 2017 election.

His re-election, once in doubt, is increasingly looking like a mere formality.
