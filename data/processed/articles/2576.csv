The Kremlin's advance towards Kiev has been stopped, according to British military intelligence

Russian troops have entered this morning, on the eighth day of the military offensive, in the strategic city of Kherson, with a port on the Black Sea.

The mayor of the municipality, Igor Kolykhayev, assured in a statement that the Russian troops had entered the local government headquarters and were deployed in the streets, and called on citizens to only leave the house during the day, one by one or two by two.

""There are armed visitors at the city hall,"" Kolykhayev said.

""I have not made any promises to them, I have only asked them not to shoot anyone.""

The Russian Defense Ministry has assured that they have taken control of Kherson, reports Reuters, while the president, Volodímir Zelenski, has stated in a video that Ukrainian troops are still fighting in the city.

""We have broken the enemy's plans in a week.""

Some plans, Zelensky has said, that the Kremlin has taken ""years to design"".

""They are petty, they hate our country and our people.""

The conquest of Kherson (290,000 registered) would facilitate the attack on Odessa, the other great city on the Black Sea, with 993,000 inhabitants and, therefore, control of the Ukrainian outlet to the sea.

He would do it in waters where three other countries have coastlines: Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.

It also opens the way for Russian forces to Mykolaiv, a large city of half a million people that is already under attack.

The Russian forces have not been able to continue advancing towards Kiev, but in the early hours of this Thursday, around one in the morning, four loud explosions have been heard in the center, while hours before another strong detonation damaged a pipe that could leave no heat apart from the city.

The Russian invasion has already killed 2,000 civilians, according to Ukraine's emergency services, in the biggest attack on a European state since 1945.

Another of Putin's strategic objectives is the large southern town of Mariupol, with 446,000 inhabitants, already almost completely surrounded.

There, most neighborhoods have been without heat, gas or electricity for days;

some also without water.

Russia has bombed the city's electrical substations, cutting off supplies to facilitate the siege.

It is a city with a strategic naval industry, northwest of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014 and which the Kremlin has used as a launch pad in the invasion.

The Russian Army, which had been attacking the town for several days, entered the city on Tuesday and continues with the siege.

Mariupol is a prized piece for Putin.

Taking it would allow it to facilitate the construction of a long-awaited corridor linking Crimea and Donbas.

Resistance

Since the United States published the images of a huge Russian convoy of more than 12 kilometers 60 kilometers from Kiev, it was expected that the fall of the capital was imminent.

British military intelligence has assured this Thursday that progress is slow, ""little progress"", towards Kiev.

This situation is repeated, according to the same sources, in the cities of Kharkov, Mariupol and Chernígov, which British intelligence considers to be still under Ukrainian control.

""The large Russian column heading for Kiev is still 30 kilometers from the city center and has been delayed by strong Ukrainian resistance, mechanical problems and congestion,"" says British Defense.

This means that the convoy has barely made any progress in the last three days.

""Although the Russian bombardment of Kharkov, Mariupol and Chernigov has been very heavy, the cities are still under Ukrainian rule and despite the fact that Russian troops have entered Kherson, the military situation is still unclear.""

The United States has called on Russia to ""immediately"" stop ""bloodshed"" and withdraw troops from Ukraine.

In addition, he has accused Moscow of launching an ""all-out war on press freedom and truth"" by blocking independent media outlets and social media to prevent Russians from hearing news of the Ukraine invasion.

At the same time as the war in Ukraine is going on, the country's Paralympics are in place. - It is a miracle that we have come here, says Valery Sushkevich, chairman of Ukraine's Paralympic Committee.

The Ukrainian national team arrived at the Paralympics on Wednesday.

A journey that was greatly hampered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

- We traveled through and from Ukraine for many days.

We overcame many obstacles along the way.

Many in our team had to flee at the same time as it was bombed, says Valery Sushkevich at a press conference in Beijing.

Susjkevytj says that the team was divided when the war broke out.

Some were in Ukraine and some were outside the country's borders.

- It is a miracle that we have come here.

It's unbelievable that we are at the Paralympics because we were faced with a question every day: Is there a way to bring both parts of the team together and take us from Europe to Beijing ?, he says.

The 20 Ukrainian practitioners and nine guides arrived in Beijing on Wednesday.

Two days before the games are inaugurated, the first competitions start on Saturday.

That they are in place is of great importance, Susjkevytj believes.

- A great power wants to destroy my country, our country.

Our presence at the Paralympics is not just about being here, we are not just one of all the teams that have come here.

This is a sign that Ukraine is and will be a country.

It shows that Ukraine is alive.

Yesterday, the decision was made by the International Paralympic Committee not to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paralympics.

- It was a very important decision, says Susjkevytj.

>lack of manpower/equipment?

>logistics in getting troops where they can be formed into competent formations?

Mainly that they are launching a three-front war and they would have to sacrifice their reserves in Western Ukraine to avoid a loss (and their Western forces appear to be sitting on their asses deliberately either because of orders or because they are playing dumb).Yes. The ""shock and awe"" aspect of Russia's initial punitive invasion either knocked out a large portion of Ukraine's military airports or made them unable to access at full scale with full forces. Because of this they lack air power and are only barely managing to prevent Russian air superiority right now. think Chinese airforce vs Taiwanese airforce except spread out over a country the size and geography of Texas. Without air superiority they are having to rely on digging in and holding cities, which was working up until the Russians began to bring in heavy equipment yesterday and changed their no-civilian-casualties policy to ""burn it all"" policy for anywhere Ukrainian forces try to bunker down. Until yesterday the war was being fought by Russian conscripts using outdated late-soviet-era equipment which wore down the Ukrainian forces using brand new Western equipment. Now the Russians are sending in their more modern equipment and the results can be seen from the war maps two days ago in the heavily contested regions (Sumy, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kherson) vs today and likely tomorrow's maps. The Ukrainians were had thinking they were dealing with the main Russian assault and thus going all-out on defense (admittedly taking out more Russians than I expected) when they were just dealing with the pre-assault forces. The real fun will begin probably this weekend.They are already formed into competent formations as mentioned in >>25993 the issue is that Ukraine is a corrupt shithole that didn't invest properly into military infrastructure over the last almost-decade and the troops can't really move from the locations they are at since they are getting pressed on all sides with Ukrainian military leadership seeming to be of the belief that death is better than routing your army to fight another day. Zelensky is pushing a war to the last drop of blood rather than bunkering down on the Western side of the river, so he's (unwisely) forcing his troops out East to die a dog's death to save his skin out West, and those Eastern troops are his veteran elite. The only comparable group are the specialist mountain brigades but if you take them out of the mountains you're royally fucked.",https://anon.cafe/k/res/25279.html
