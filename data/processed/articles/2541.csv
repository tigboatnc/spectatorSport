Oleh Bulavenko's death was captured in the footage filmed by his son on the outskirts of Kyiv, as they tried to take their pet dogs to safety

The sham of President Putin's claims to not be targeting civilians was laid bare last night as video emerged of a family car being strafed by tank fire on a quiet country road outside Kyiv.

The Russian leader yesterday delivered an address claiming 'gangster' Ukrainian leaders using 'human shields' was the real reason so many civilians had been killed by his troops' onslaught in the country.

But within hours footage emerged showing a father and his adult son having tank rounds unleashed on them as they attempted to rescue their three dogs, having already once fled their home town near Kyiv.

The son who shot the harrowing footage – who hasn't been named by local media – was filming from the passenger seat as their car was forced to pull over by the side of the road after encountering a Russian convoy.

After they stop and as he is asking his father to reverse, and with the army a considerable distance away, bullets tear into the vehicle.

'Get out and lie down,' he shouts at his father, named by media as Oleh Bulavenko. 'Can you hear me? Get back and duck to the right.'

Seconds later more rounds smash into the car. The dogs in the back can be heard wimpering in fear and pain.

The son, whose passenger door is closest to shelter, jumps out into undergrowth but his father must exit into the road. Dozens more shots ring out before the son crawls round the back of the car to find his father lying prone in the road.

'Dad! Dad!' he cries out in anguish. 'Are you still there? Hang in there!'

He tells his father to stay down as the older man tries to sit up to look at his wounds. The footage shows the bullets have torn right through the family saloon leaving large exit holes on the boot despite entering from the front.

'Dad, f***! Why?' the son plaintively asks.

As the shooting subsides, the son crawls from the back of the car again.

'My foot is torn off,' the father growls in agony as he lies in a pool of blood.

The son bravely breaks cover and drags his father into the undergrowth.

The father could be seen lying motionless in the middle of the country lane after the pair were struck with gunshots from a distance

'Please don't die, I'm begging you,' he implores.

But moments later his father died from his injuries, lying in the ditch he was dragged into.

Footage then shows the family pets ripped apart on the backseat of the car. One dog survived the attack, and went to sit with the dead man's body in the gully, refusing to leave.

The heartbreaking footage, which was uncovered and verified by Radio Free Europe, was believed to have been filmed last Friday. The family fled their home in Ivankiv in the Kyiv region after Russian's initial attacks, but returned to get their pets.

Local reporters said they had confirmed no Ukrainian troops were in the area of the attack, which witnesses said came from Russian military vehicles.

The footage graphically exposes the lies of the Kremlin regime who have repeatedly insisted civilians are not being targeted, despite mounting evidence to the contrary.

Putin yesterday hailed his soldiers as heroes who are fighting to save innocent lives and blamed Ukrainian 'neo-Nazis' for holding citizens hostage.

Putin made the claim in his address yesterday, his first since announcing the start of his 'special operation' eight days ago, which did little to reassure anyone that the war is close to being over, or that Russia can be brought to the negotiating table without more blood being shed.

But it also hinted that Putin is rattled as the fighting proves harder than Russian commanders anticipated, and western sanctions go harder and deeper than even European or American observers predicted. All hope of a swift victory has now been dashed, leaving Putin facing a long, bloody and expensive war to achieve his aims.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on his Russian counterpart to sit down with him at the negotiating table in person during another impassioned television appearance shortly after the address.

Zelensky's comments came as Putin's forces continued their brutal assault on several of Ukraine's cities, and on the same day negotiations between the two sides made little progress in deescalating the deadly war.

And the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was on fire in the early hours of Friday morning after an attack by Russian troops.

In an appeal to his Russian counterpart, Zelensky said: 'Get off our land. You don't want to leave now? Then sit down with me at the negotiation table. I'm available. Sit. Just not 30 metres away like with Macron or Scholz etc. I am your neighbour. You don't need to keep me 30 metres away.

'I don't bite. I'm a normal bloke. Sit down with me and talk. What are you afraid of? We aren't threatening anyone, we're not terrorists, we aren't seizing banks and seizing foreign land.'

Zelensky's comments came during a press conference in Kyiv and in response to a reporter's question on what 'guarantees' Ukraine can offer.

'Guarantees for what?' Zelensky fired back at the interviewer in Russian. 'We aren't attacking Russia and we have no intention of doing so. Guarantee what? We aren't in NATO. We don't have nuclear weapons. What am I supposed to say, what am I supposed to give, and to whom?

'You must understand - this is also a huge thing that everybody is talking about - what am I supposed to give? Jesus, what do you want from us?!'

Ukraine's president, who has become an inspirational figure both at home and abroad for his defiance in the face of Russian aggression, also called on the West to supply planes to help his military control the skies. It came after NATO members ruled out enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine for fear of igniting World War Three.

Ukraine war: City by city Kyiv: Four large rocket strikes hit the Ukrainian capital overnight, including one which struck a train station being used to evacuate civilians , while others struck TV and radio stations. Ukraine claimed to have shot down a Russian fighter jet over Irpin, a satellite city of Kyiv which has come under heavy attack, in the early hours of Thursday Kharkiv: The second-largest city in Ukraine continue to come under bombardment with pictures showing destroyed residential buildings and rubble littering the city centre. Izyum, a city 70 miles to the south of Kharkiv towards Donetsk, also came under heavy bombardment with explosions lighting up the night sky Chernihiv: Located to the north-west of Kyiv, the city has been the site of fierce fighting with Russian troops since the early days of the invasion Despite being surrounded and under heavy shelling, the city remains under Ukrainian control Mariupol: Heavy Russian shelling which began targeting the city on Wednesday continued into Thursday, with the mayor saying the bombardment is so heavy that medics can't get into the streets to rescue the dead and injured Despite the attacks, the city remains in Ukrainian hands Kherson: City feared captured by Russian forces after mayor says 'armed visitors' joined a local council meeting and had imposed a curfew However, the British MoD said Thursday morning that the military situation is still 'unclear' - suggesting that Russia may not be in full control Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces have surrounded the city and its nuclear power plant, which is the largest in Europe Civilians set up road blocks around the plant to defend it, with the city's mayor saying one came under fire by Russian troops on Wednesday leaving two people hurt Odessa: The Black Sea port city, and Ukraine's main naval base, is preparing for a Russian assault after a dozen warships were seen forming up near Crimea Mayor said fighter jets appear to be testing air defences by flying sorties overhead, as residents prepare makeshift defences made of old railway sleepers and lay landmines on the beach Advertisement

'If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!' Zelensky told a news conference. 'If we are no more then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next,' he said, adding that direct talks with Putin were 'the only way to stop this war'.

Zelensky - who just weeks ago sought to calm Ukrainians over US allegations that Russia was planning to invade his country - said: 'Nobody thought that in the modern world a man can behave like a beast.'

Soon after Putin's address, Ukraine announced that it has agreed with Russia to create safe corridors - backed by ceasefires - to evacuate civilians and deliver aid to areas under attack by Russian forces. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky also said the agreement had been made during talks, describing it as 'substantial progress'.

The agreement was the only tangible progress from a second round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv, according to an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it was not immediately clear how they would work.

Negotiators from Ukraine and Russia said afterwards that a third round of talks on the war will be held shortly.

So far, more than one million people have fled Ukraine as Putin's armies have laid waste to key cities.

Meanwhile the Russian economy is tanking with the ruble at record lows, the stock market unable to open because it faces near-total collapse, and European countries seizing assets from billionaire oligarchs. Protests have also sprung up in Russia, coupled with high-profile political figures and celebrities calling for the war to end.

Just hours before the TV address, Putin had phoned Emmanuel Macron to tell the French President that he has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or watering down his security demands, will achieve his aims 'whatever happens' and will continue fighting until 'the end'.

Macron's aides said after the call that they believe Putin intends to take the whole country, and that the 'worst is yet to come' as the Russian attacks step up, and that 'there was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us.'

Mr Macron is said to have told Putin he is making a 'major mistake' and 'lying to himself'. Macron said Russia would end up poor, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.

'There was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us. He showed great determination to continue the operation,' Macron's aide said, before adding that Putin 'wanted to seize control of the whole of Ukraine'.

Putin's two statements today - the first he has made in public since announcing the start of his 'special operation' eight days ago - will do little to reassure anyone that the war is close to being over, or that Russia could be brought to the negotiating table without more blood being shed.

News that the convoy has been at least partially damaged or destroyed will come as a huge boon to the people of Kyiv, as it was feared the vehicles would be used to surround and bomb the city into submission. The Ukrainian capital is still under attack by Russian rockets and missiles, but has largely escaped the intense fire being rained down on other locations.

Perhaps the hardest-hit has been the city of Mariupol, on Ukraine's eastern Black Sea coast, which came under bombardment by Russian forces surrounding it yesterday - with the fire kept up near-continuously into today. Local officials say the city is without water, heat, or electricity, and cannot clear the dead from the streets.

Harrowing pictures revealed at least part of the civilian death toll, with a father seen weeping over the body of his son who was killed when a Russian shell destroyed his legs. Two elderly women were also pictured being evacuated from their homes and covered in blood after Russian attacks.

Despite the vicious shelling, the city still remains in the hands of Ukrainian forces - as a defiant Zelensky vowed today that Ukraine will be rebuilt with Russian money as he praised his troops' 'heroic' defence.

Kharkiv, in the east, and Chernihiv, in the north west, also remained under Ukrainian control despite coming under heavy rocket fire. Nine people died in Chernihiv after Russian rockets hit a school and nearby apartments. There were also fears the Russians were about to launch a major amphibious assault against the port city of Odessa after a large fleet of ships was spotted near Crimea in the early hours.

The Ukrainian president said that 'all lines of defence are holding' with the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mykolaiv all resisting Russian attacks. He even claimed the city of Kherson remains in Ukrainian hands, despite the mayor seeming to confirm overnight that it had been taken by Russian forces.

'They wanted to destroy us. They failed. We've been through so much. And if anyone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken or surrender, they know nothing about Ukraine,' Zelensky said, adding: 'We will restore every house, every street, every city and we say to Russia: learn the word 'reparations'.

'You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.'

Separately, one of his presidential advisers said the Ukrainian army is now getting ready to launch counter-attacks on Russian forces after their initial assault on the country stalled - amid reported of fuel and food shortages, heavy casualties, and mismanagement of the operation.

'Help to us is increasing every minute and the strength of the enemy is decreasing every minute. We're not only defending but also counter-attacking,' the adviser said in a televised briefing.

President Zelensky's office said a second round of negotiations had concluded. A first round of talks on Monday ended without an agreement.

Ahead of the invasion, Washington had warned that Russia's superior forces would be able to quickly overwhelm Ukraine's 200,000-strong army - taking out air defences, achieving superiority in the skies, and then raining death down on those below.

But none of that has come to pass. Ukraine's skies remain contested, US intelligence says, while attacks have been piecemeal with troops under-supplied and not fighting in a coordinated fashion, leading to large numbers of dead along with some abandoning their vehicles which have then been captured.

'This is a colossal intelligence failure that vastly underestimated Ukrainian resistance, and military execution has been terrible,' Michael Vickers, former US Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

'[Putin's] main attack has been underweighted. It's been piecemeal. His reconnaissance elements have been captured, columns have been destroyed,' he said. 'It's just a disaster, through and through.'

But many caution that Russia's initial failures could simply pre-sage a secondary phase of the fighting in which it uses superior numbers and force of arms to surround and bomb Ukrainian troops into submission, causing large civilian casualties.

Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, agreed with that assessment today as he issued a warning that the 'worst' is still to come as Russia switches to a 'logic of siege' with major cities in danger of being surrounded.

Macron: 'Delusional' Putin is intent on seizing 'the whole' of Ukraine to achieve 'de-nazification' French President Emmanuel Macron believes 'the worst is yet to come' in Ukraine after 90-minute phone call with Vladimir Putin ended with his Russian counterpart declaring his goals will be achieved 'in any case'. In the phone call initiated by Putin today, the Russian leader reiterated his determination to 'neutralise' Ukraine, whether diplomatically or by force, a senior aide to Macron said. 'The expectation of the president is that the worst is to come, given what President Putin told him,' the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. 'There was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us. He showed great determination to continue the operation,' the aide continued, before adding that Putin 'wanted to seize control of the whole of Ukraine'. 'He will, in his own words, carry out his operation to ''de-Nazify'' Ukraine to the end.' Macron in return told Putin he was making a 'major mistake' by invading a sovereign nation, that he was deluding himself about the government in Kyiv, and that the war would cost Russia dearly over the long term. The French President also urged Putin to avoid civilian casualties and allow for humanitarian access. It comes as the civilian death toll in Ukraine continues to climb as Russian forces carry out a sustained bombing campaign of several major cities including Kharkiv, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and capital Kyiv. After having shared several direct calls with Putin in an attempt to avert war in recent weeks, Macron today told the Russian President directly that he was 'delusional' in light of his invasion of Ukraine. 'You are lying to yourself,' the French President said according to the aide. '[This invasion] will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.' Despite their drastically opposed viewpoints however, there were no signs of aggression between the pair on the call. 'President Putin has a way of talking that is very neutral and very clinical. He sometimes shows signs of impatience, but fundamentally there were no open signs of tensions during the exchanges,' Macron's aide suggested. Advertisement

He spoke as Europe continued to step up its assistance to Ukraine, with Germany pledging another 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to bolster the Ukrainian defences. That comes on top of 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger anti-aircraft weapons it has already sent, in a stunning reversal of its long-standing pledge not to supply weapons.

Kyiv has so-far escaped what observers feared would be Russian attempts to surround and bomb it into submission, after skirmishes in the outskirts led to Moscow's men being pushed back. Sight of the convoy earlier this week seemed to confirm that Putin would resort to 'siege' tactics to force a bloody victory.

But, as of Thursday morning, the convoy was near-motionless - having stalled late Monday. The exact reason is unclear, but American and British intelligence believe it is due to a combination of Ukrainian resistance and logistical problems within the convoy itself.

Reports from the ground indicate that Russian vehicles have been running out of fuel, while pictures also appear to show some vehicles have been poorly maintained and their tyres are falling apart.

A Pantsir missile system bogged down and abandoned in a muddy field lost several of its tyres when Ukrainian forces tried to tow it away, with Trent Teletenko - a former Department of Defence civil servant - wrote on Twitter that it appears Russia has failed to maintain the tyres on its vehicles properly, leaving them brittle.

According to his analysis, it means lowering the pressure in the tyres - which is typically done so they can drive off-road - will cause them to shred, meaning the trucks and artillery systems will be confined to highways or else risk getting bogged down in mud.

Other images showed armoured vehicles bogged down and abandoned after Russian forces tried laying sawed-down trees under their wheels to keep them out of the muck.

Whatever the case, the longer the Russian convoy remains stuck the more vulnerable it becomes to Ukrainian counter attack and the longer the people of Kyiv get to go about their lives without the risk of being shelled.

In just seven days of fighting, more than 2% of Ukraine's population has been forced out of the country, according to the tally the U.N. refugee agency released to The Associated Press.

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, a city of about 1.4 million people and Ukraine's second-largest. Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and another 525 wounded in that time, according to the latest figures from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. It acknowledges that is a vast undercount, and Ukraine earlier said more than 2,000 civilians have died. That figure could not be independently verified.

As the toll of war mounted, a second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was expected later Thursday in neighboring Belarus - though the two sides appeared to have little common ground.

'We are ready to conduct talks, but we will continue the operation because we won't allow Ukraine to preserve a military infrastructure that threatens Russia,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, repeating an accusation Moscow has repeatedly used to justify its invasion.

Lavrov said that the West has continuously armed Ukraine, trained its troops and built up bases there to turn Ukraine into a bulwark against Russia.

The U.S. and its allies have insisted that NATO is a defensive alliance that doesn't pose a threat to Russia. And the West fears Russia's invasion is meant to overthrow Ukraine's government and install a friendly government - though Lavrov said Moscow would let the Ukrainians choose what government they should have.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier raised the specter of nuclear war, putting his country's nuclear forces on high alert, but his foreign minister shrugged off questions of whether Russia could escalate the conflict with nuclear weapons, saying such talk comes from the West.

In Kherson, the Russians took over the regional administration headquarters, Hennady Lahuta, the governor of the region, said Thursday - while adding that he and other officials were continuing to perform their duties and provide assistance to the population.

Kherson's mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, previously said that the national flag was still flying, but that there were no Ukrainian troops in the city. Britain's defense secretary said it was possible the Russians had taken over, though not yet verified.

The mayor said the city would maintain a strict curfew and require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to 'provoke the troops.'

'The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,' he wrote on Facebook. 'And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.'

Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian land forces have stalled and Moscow is now unleashing air attacks, but that they are being parried by Ukrainian defense systems, including in Kherson.

'Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack. Our air defenses worked,' he said. 'Kherson, Izyum - all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.'

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions heard overnight in the Ukrainian capital were Russian missiles being shot down by air defense systems.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center to the west along the coast. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops are advancing on the city but said that they will likely need to regroup before trying to take it over.

A group of Russian amphibious landing vessels is also heading toward the port of Odesa, farther west, the Ukrainian military said.

Moscow's isolation deepened when most of the world lined up against it at the United Nations to demand it withdraw from Ukraine. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes. And in a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Winter Paralympic Games.

Russia reported its military casualties Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses.

Ukraine's military general staff said in a Facebook post that Russia's forces had suffered some 9,000 casualties in the fighting. It did not clarify if that figure included both killed and wounded soldiers.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskyy praised his country's resistance.

'We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,' he said. 'They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.'

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who 'go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.'

'These are not warriors of a superpower,' he said. 'These are confused children who have been used.'

Meanwhile, the senior U.S. defense official said an immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteers well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance.

'In my old age, I had to take up arms,' said Andrey Goncharuk, 68. He said the fighters needed more weapons, but 'we'll kill the enemy and take their weapons.'

Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees.

Among the million-plus refugees who have fled Ukraine in recent days were some 200 orphans with severe physical and mental disabilities who arrived from Kyiv by train in Hungary on Wednesday.

Some of them spent more than an hour in underground shelters during a bombing, said Larissa Leonidovna, the director of the Svyatoshinksy orphanage for boys.

Overnight, Associated Press reporters in Kyiv heard at least one explosion before videos started circulating of apparent strikes on the capital.

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had knocked out a reserve broadcasting center in the Lysa Hora district, about 7 kilometers (4 miles) south of the government headquarters. It said unspecified precision weapons were used, and that there were no casualties or damage to residential buildings.

A statement from the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces didn't address the strikes, saying only that Russian forces were 'regrouping' and 'trying to reach the northern outskirts' of the city.

'The advance on Kyiv has been rather not very organized and now they're more or less stuck,' military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told the AP in Moscow.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and another 525 wounded since the invasion began, according to the latest figures from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Earlier, Ukraine said more than 2,000 civilians have died, a figure that could not be independently verified.

The U.N. office uses strict methodology and counts only confirmed casualties, and admits its figures are a vast undercount.

Still, the tally eclipses the entire civilian casualty count from the fighting in 2014 in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces - which left 136 dead and 577 injured.

In a videotaped address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance. He vowed that the invaders would have 'not one quiet moment' and described Russian soldiers as 'confused children who have been used.'

Moscow's isolation deepened when most of the world lined up against it at the United Nations to demand it withdraw from Ukraine. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes. And in a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Winter Paralympic Games.

Felgenhauer said with the Russian economy already suffering, there could be a 'serious internal political crisis' if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not find a way to end the war quickly.

'There's no real money to run to fight this war,' he said, adding that if Putin and the military 'are unable to wrap up this campaign very swiftly and victoriously, they're in a pickle.'

Several parts of the country were under pressure.

Ukraine's military said Russian forces 'did not achieve the main goal of capturing Mariupol' in its statement, which did not mention the another important port, Kherson, whose status was unclear.

Putin's forces claimed to have taken complete control of Kherson, and U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Thursday that it was 'possible - it's not verified yet - that Russia is in control' there.

A senior U.S. defense official earlier disputed the Russians controlled the city.

'Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city,' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Zelenskyy's office told the AP that it could not comment on the situation in Kherson while the fighting was still going on.

The mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhaev, said Russian soldiers were in the city and came to the city administration building. He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets.

'We don't have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE,' he said in a statement later posted on Facebook.

The mayor said Kherson would maintain a strict 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and restrict traffic into the city to food and medicine deliveries. The city will also require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to 'provoke the troops.'

'The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,' he wrote. 'And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.'

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the attacks there had been relentless.

'We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop,' he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.

Russia reported its military casualties for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses.

Ukraine's military general staff said in a Facebook post that Russia's forces had suffered some 9,000 casualties in the fighting. It did not clarify if that figure included both killed and wounded soldiers.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskyy praised his country's resistance.

'We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,' he said. 'They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.'

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who 'go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.'

'These are not warriors of a superpower,' he said. 'These are confused children who have been used.'

Meanwhile, the senior U.S. defense official said an immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteers well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance.

'In my old age, I had to take up arms,' said Andrey Goncharuk, 68. He said the fighters needed more weapons, but 'we'll kill the enemy and take their weapons.'

Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees.

In an email, U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams told the AP that the refugee count surpassed 1 million as of midnight in central Europe, based on figures collected by national authorities.

Shabia Mantoo, another spokesperson for the agency, said that 'at this rate' the exodus from Ukraine could make it the source of 'the biggest refugee crisis this century.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10575937/So-humans-shielding-Putin-Family-cut-tank-fire-country-lane.html

4,5bf93d2f-62a6-41a1-932f-85d24de05ddc,['Wire Services'],2022-03-03 00:00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing Ukrainian city by shelling Europe’s largest nuclear plant early Friday, sparking a fire and raising fears that radiation could leak from the damaged power station.

The assault on the eastern city of Enerhodar and its Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant came as the invasion entered its second week with Russian forces gaining ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea. Elsewhere, another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors inside Ukraine to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.

Nuclear plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the facility and had set fire to one of its six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.

Firefighters cannot get near the flames because they are being shot at, he said, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a plea to the Russians to stop the assault and allow fire teams inside.

“We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,” Tuz said in a video statement. “There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.”

The attack renewed fears that the invasion could result in damage to one of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and trigger another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 65 miles north of the capital.

The American Nuclear Society condemned the attack but said the latest radiation levels remained within natural background levels.

“The real threat to Ukrainian lives continues to be the violent invasion and bombing of their country,” the group said in a statement from President Steven Nesbit and Executive Director and CEO Craig Piercy.

The plant’s reactor is a different type than the one used at Chernobyl, and there should be little risk if the containment vessel is not damaged and outside power can be restored, said Jon B. Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council and former special adviser to then-Vice President Joe Biden.

“Everyone needs to take a step back and not jump to conclusions,” Wolfsthal, now a senior adviser at Global Zero, said on Twitter.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was in contact with authorities in Ukraine. The agency’s director general, Mariano Grossi, urged military forces to refrain from violence near the plant.

The mayor of Enerhodar said earlier that Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars, just a day after the U.N. atomic watchdog agency expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors.

The Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.

“Many young men in athletic clothes and armed with Kalashnikovs have come into the city. They are breaking down doors and trying to get into the apartments of local residents,” the statement from Energoatom said.

Later, a live streamed security camera linked from the homepage of the Zaporizhzhia plant showed what appeared to be armored vehicles rolling into the facility’s parking lot and shining spotlights on the building where the camera was mounted.

There were then what appeared to be bright muzzle flashes from vehicles, followed by nearly simultaneous explosions in the surrounding buildings. Smoke then rose into the frame and drifted away.

While the huge Russian armored column threatening Kyiv appeared bogged down outside the capital, Vladimir Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called on the West to close the skies over the country’s nuclear plants as fighting intensified. “It is a question of the security of the whole world!” he said in a statement.

The U.S. and NATO allies have ruled out creating a no-fly zone since the move would pit Russian and Western military forces against each other.

The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. The battles have knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.

Associated Press video from the port city shows the assault lighting up the darkening sky above largely deserted streets and medical teams treating civilians, including one inside a clinic who appeared to be a child. Doctors were unable to save the person.

Severing Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014.

Overall, the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia’s seizure of Crimea gave it a logistical advantage in that part of the country, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the offensive there.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

“Total resistance. ... This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we can do best in the world,” Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.

The second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was held in neighboring Belarus. But the two sides appeared far apart going into the meeting, and Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin’s demand for its “demilitarization” and declare itself neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.

Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron he was determined to press on with his attack “until the end,” according to Macron’s office.

The two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelenskyy adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

Despite a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of property by the Russian military, Putin decried what he called an “anti-Russian disinformation campaign” and insisted that Moscow uses “only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure.”

Putin claimed that the Russian military had already offered safe corridors for civilians to flee, but he asserted without evidence that Ukrainian “neo-Nazis” were preventing people from leaving and were using them as human shields.

He also hailed Russian soldiers as heroes in a video call with members of Russia’s Security Council, and ordered additional payments to families of men killed or wounded.

A top Russian officer, Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, commander of an airborne division, was killed in the fighting earlier this week, an officers organization in Russia reported.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia’s Ministry of Defense earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.

The fighting has sent more than 1 million people fleeing Ukraine, according to the U.N., which fears those refugee numbers could skyrocket.

The immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles still appeared to be stalled roughly 15 miles from Kyiv and had made no real progress in days, amid fuel and food shortages, according to U.S. authorities.

Staggered by blasts pummeling the city, cut off from heat through freezing nights, and running low on food and water, the people of Mariupol, Ukraine, have been trapped by Russia’s siege.

In interviews, residents and local officials in Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov, described nightmarish conditions after five days of shelling by Russian forces around the city. On Sunday, city officials said they would attempt to resume an evacuation effort that was called off a day earlier because of Russian attacks.

“There’s no electricity, no heating, no telephone connection. It is absolute horror,” said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol. “People drink from puddles in the streets.”

The shelling has destroyed the city’s left bank district, he said, making it “unfit for human life.” The city had not been able to accurately count the dead or even help many of the wounded because of the barrage, he added.

“It just never stops,” he said. “Everyone who tries to go outside risks their life. That is why the mayor can’t ask people to do that, it would be like sending people to a certain death.”

Videos have shown explosions rocking Mariupol’s residential areas and starting fires, as well as the ruins of shops and cars around city.

“The shelling is constant and at random,” said a resident, Diana Berg. “When you’re on the street, at any moment, a rocket can land next to you.” She said that people were still braving the streets to make fires for warmth.

On Saturday, city leaders halted a planned evacuation because of the shelling, and accused Russian forces of violating a temporary cease-fire that was meant to allow some of the city’s nearly half-million residents to flee. President Vladimir V. Putin blamed Ukraine for sabotaging the humanitarian routes.

Mikhail Vershinin, the head of the Donetsk Regional Patrol Police, said that several hundred cars had planned to form convoys to leave the city through the humanitarian corridor.

“As soon as we sent the cars back home, the offensive attacks in that region began,” he said. The city, he said, was facing “a humanitarian catastrophe.”

Mr. Andryushchenko, the mayor’s adviser, said that city officials were wary of the Russian forces even as they gathered people for the planned evacuation, and could not send residents out because the route was too dangerous. “There was no cease-fire for the whole length of the corridor and Russian troops continued to attack our positions,” he said. “That is why we did not let the people board the buses.”

The city’s leaders had not given up, Mr. Andryushchenko said, and were trying to negotiate another evacuation attempt through the blockade. “It is literally our last hope,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/05/world/russia-ukraine
6,5bf93d2f-62a6-41a1-932f-85d24de05ddc,"['Analysis Nathan Hodge', 'Tara John', 'Josh Berlinger']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Moscow (CNN) Russia's assault on Ukraine is just a week old, but its consequences have already been catastrophic.

In the seven days since Russian troops invaded their western neighbor, hundreds of people have been reported dead and one million have fled for their lives . Energy prices are skyrocketing and food prices could be next

No one can say for sure what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but years of relative peace and stability in Europe have already been ruptured, and should the fighting stretch on for months, the crisis could have even greater ramifications.

What happens to Kyiv?

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been very clear about his basic goals in invading: He wants to disarm Ukraine, sever its ties to the NATO military alliance and end the Ukrainian people's aspirations of joining the West.

He has also said he wants to rid the country of what he calls the ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people,"" a baseless and highly-charged reference to Ukraine's democratically-elected government and its Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky

Russian forces are encircling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in an apparent push to topple the government, and a 40-mile-long military convoy is edging toward the city, which has been targeted by multiple rocket and missile attacks in recent days.

Zelensky has vowed to keep fighting, but he is under no illusions that Putin's forces ""want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.""

Should those forces take the capital, Ukraine does have other politicians who might be eager to fill the ranks of a pro-Russian puppet regime.

One of Putin's top allies in Ukraine is Viktor Medvedchuk , a prominent politician and oligarch. He faces allegations of treason in Ukraine and has been under house arrest, but his exact whereabouts are unclear.

Territorial goals

Russian forces are also waging campaigns far from Kyiv, attempting to take control of key cities in Ukraine's south and southeast, including Kherson.

The mayor of Kherson effectively admitted that Ukrainian forces had ceded control of the city on Wednesday, saying in a statement on his Facebook page that residents would have to accept the direction of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- in other words, Russian forces.

One former NATO Commander told CNN: ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea."" Richard Shirreff, NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, said the land corridor was ""an obvious objective.""

""He's had Crimea in the Russian Federation since 2014, he's only been able to supply it across the Kerch Strait bridge, and so of course he's looking to establish that land corridor down off the Sea of Azov,"" Shirreff added.

If Russian forces capture the port city of Odessa, it is possible to imagine Moscow creating a land bridge extending all the way across southern Ukraine, potentially even linking Transnistria -- a separatist enclave in Moldova, where Russian troops are stationed -- to Odessa, Crimea and southern and eastern Ukraine.

A partitioned Ukraine

Parts of modern-day Ukraine previously belonged to interwar Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania -- and before that, to the Austro-Hungarian empire. If Putin has partition in mind, Galician Ukraine and the city of Lviv -- close to the Polish border -- could potentially be a part of a sort of rump Ukrainian state, while Russia focuses its attentions on the east of the country.

A division along these lines could make Ukraine ""look like Germany in the Cold War era, with western Ukraine more dependent on Europe, and the Eastern part"" sucked into the Russian spheres of influence, which include Belarus, Russian historian and author Alexander Etkind told CNN.

That kind of redrawing of borders may be an expansionist fantasy, but it could separate out what Moscow -- justifiably or not -- perceives as a more nationalist part of Ukraine.

Scorched earth battle tactics

So far, Ukrainian forces have managed to hold their own against the bigger and much better equipped Russian military

US officials have noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces.

But US administration officials expect Russia to ramp up its operations in Ukraine, and Putin has previously shown scant regard for human rights or the rules of modern warfare.

Russia's air force backed President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, providing overwhelming firepower to crush the country's armed opposition groups and flattening entire neighborhoods in the process.

Experts fear the Kremlin could resort to this kind of scorched earth policy in Ukraine, should resistance efforts continue to thwart their plans.

Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said Monday that the Russian military had already started using such tactics, including cluster bomb munitions. He also said the Kremlin was bringing in thermobaric munitions -- sometimes known as vacuum bombs -- which create a prolonged pressure wave that can suck the oxygen out of a room or a person's lungs. Use of such weaponry in civilian areas is proscribed by international humanitarian law.

""I fear we'll see more of that,"" Petraeus said. ""They will rubble some cities, I suspect, because in some ways they almost have to depopulate areas or they are not secure in them, and we've seen them do that in the past.""

The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday that Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine: ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield.""

US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he believes Russia is intentionally targeting civilians in Ukraine -- but declined to say whether he believed war crimes were being committed.

Sanctions

The Kremlin acknowledged Wednesday that Russia's economy is taking ""serious blows,"" as unprecedented sanctions and the country's growing isolation piles pressure on its tottering financial system.

International companies have begun shutting down or suspending their Russian operations.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, announced Tuesday it had stopped selling all of its products in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, while Boeing and Airbus are suspending their support for Russian airlines.

Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions, but many of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting the country or halting new investments. Moscow is also finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the net of financial sanctions.

But experts say Putin has overseen a push to wean Moscow's oil-dependent economy off the dollar in recent years, and has limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies.

Putin's economic planners have sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Moscow has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves -- a huge sum compared to most other countries -- that can be spent if sanctions bite.

It remains to be seen whether such measures will help Russia avoid economic calamity as its invasion continues.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/what-happens-next-russia-ukraine-cmd-intl/index.html

Murphy', 'Tim Lister']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) Russia's relentless bombardment of residential areas across Ukraine has so far forced more than one million refugees to flee the country in just seven days, according to the United Nations, as fierce fighting continues into its second week.

Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Thursday: ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.""

By comparison, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures there were at their height, according to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.

Half a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crises since World War II.

Millions more people are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine, Grandi said. He added: ""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy.""

In Ukraine's capital Kyiv, residents were awoken in the early hours of Thursday by at least one large explosion in the southwest of the city, following a day of heavy shelling. To the south, the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And in the port city of Mariupol , home to roughly 400,000, residents are without electricity and water, according to local officials, as Russian troops step up their offensive.

A woman sits in a tent as people take shelter in the Dorohozhychi subway station in Kyiv on Wednesday.

A resident of Kherson, which has about 300,000 inhabitants, described the situation there as a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" telling CNN Thursday there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities.

According to the local resident, there is a severe lack of food and medicine -- particularly insulin -- with pharmacies being looted.

The resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.

The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said Wednesday the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.

In Mariupol, the deputy mayor said on Thursday morning that the southeastern Ukrainian city had faced 26 hours of continued shelling and warned it now faces a humanitarian crisis.

""They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,"" Sergei Orlov told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating.""

Further north, Ukrainian resistance in the country's second biggest city, Kharkiv, continues to hold out, as Russian strikes hit at least three schools and damaged a cathedral and shops on Wednesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media, geolocated and verified by CNN.

In a broadcast message Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Russian forces, saying: ""You are leaving people without food, you are leaving us without medication. You are shelling evacuation routes, there's no weapon you wouldn't use against us, against free citizens of Ukraine.""

Most of those who have fled the country have gone to Poland, to Ukraine's west, with large numbers also entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city.

Worryingly, a ""big number"" of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland's Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents -- particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said.

Humanitarian corridors

On Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that.

Senior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: ""The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.""

The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media.

""We have thoroughly discussed three points -- military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,"" Medinsky told journalists.

Another member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the ""nearest future.""

Meanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.

The European Union has made the ""historic decision"" to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc's Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday.

The United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia's ongoing invasion.

Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally.

Bachelet said: ""Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped.""

With the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.""

The move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially ""tens of thousands"" of troops.

The Russian government has ""strongly"" rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

It's unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas.

On Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was ""gravely concerned"" by ""reports of the use of cluster munitions"" by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine.

""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs -- which are banned under the Geneva Convention,"" she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.

There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26.

The Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.

""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,"" NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN

He said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins.

""I'm afraid to say I don't think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that's likely to happen,"" Shirreff added.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl-hnk/index.html
