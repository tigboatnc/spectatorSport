As it turns out, it's not only eyes that have been zeroing in on this target.

Did Ukraine destroy Russian convoy?

Russian authorities maintain their stance that its actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists. Don't ask them to provide any real evidence for this, though. Propaganda doesn't work like that.

There is no doubt that Ukraine's military is dwarfed by that of its powerful neighbour - something we assessed earlier in the conflict - but resistance in the first week has slowed Russia's progress, particularly in urban areas. It's incredible how resilient a people can be when they have a real cause to fight for.

Russia has, of course, made significant gains, and has captured one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson - and has bombarded others with increasing intensity, including Kyiv and the country's second city Kharkiv.

But that giant column of Russian armour, which looked so threatening in the last couple of days, has stalled as it approaches Kyiv from the north, delayed by resistance, as well as mechanical failures and congestion, according to the British defence ministry. And that makes it a relatively sitting duck for the Ukranians.

One thing to note about the column is that there have been various conflicting reports about the length of it. I've seen 40 kilometres cited, as well as 64 km and 18 km, among others. The key thing to remember is that it is a moveable beast, and depending on elements such as fuel supplies or road space, the dimensions are naturally going to change. One thing that is not in doubt is that it is a mighty force, although some suggestions are that it is made up of a number of smaller groups, combined due to these problems in advancing at pace.

Which brings us to the attacks. As reported by the head of Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, Ukraine's armed forces have been firing at that long line of Russian troops.

“We are striking the enemy’s columns,” Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Military Times in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. “We burn many columns of the enemy.

“My intelligence officers and agents are directing and calling the strikes,” he said.

The strikes, he said, are being conducted by Ukraine Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets, artillery and missile barrages.

Ukraine's 'hedgehogs' face up to Russian tanks

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the violence and crossed into neighbouring countries. Men of fighting age are prevented from leaving Ukraine.

And as Russian troops closed in Kyiv on Thursday, a muddy construction site in a local neighbourhood was teeming with workers and welders of the KAN real estate developer. Instead of homes and offices, however, they were making giant, metal anti-tank barricades known as ""hedgehogs"", and smaller spiked barriers aimed at stopping wheeled vehicles. After Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, KAN, a large local property company, reinvented itself to help the defences of the city of 3.4 million people.

Zakhar, a foreman, picked up the phone and started calling the company's construction workers who had remained in Kyiv. Almost everyone volunteered to stay and contribute, he said.

""We build things. We do not know how to fight, but we knew we could be useful,"" Zakhar said. A few metres away sparks flew as builders cut through and welded together large metal beams. It is another example of how Ukrainian civilians are supporting regular troops as they try to repel Russia's advance, including through civil defence units and independent militia that have formed across the country.

Boxing champ Klitschko ready to block, parry and counter

On 25 February, Kyiv's mayor and boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, said the city ""has gone into the defensive phase.""

Heavy equipment was brought in to build concrete checkpoints, blocking positions and bunkers inside the city and along all major roads and in the suburbs.

At KAN, workers cut long pieces of girder using blow torches and angle grinders, welding them together into triangular barriers used to bolster fortifications and slow the movement of tanks and tracked armoured personnel carriers.

Oleksandr Bodyuk, the company's deputy director, said workers were also using reinforcing bars and girders salvaged from construction sites to produce spiked, movable defences against wheeled vehicles, including trucks.

So far the makeshift factory, which started operating this week, has produced 110 large hedgehogs, including 40 in the fist 12 hours, Bodyuk said, adding that the company runs other similar sites in the city.

""We have demands from many places for these types of blocking devices, we deliver them wherever they are needed in the area ... subcontractors and friends are providing transportation for the products and the material,"" he said.

Andriy Kryschenko, Kyiv's deputy mayor who was wearing military fatigues, said many similar firms and workshops had adapted to produce hedgehogs, concrete barriers and other defences.

He added that tens of thousands of people in Kyiv had received weapons and many more were waiting at enlistment and recruitment offices. The city hall was also supporting Territorial Defence units and troops at the frontline, Kryschenko said.

At the construction site, Serhiy Serdyuk, a grizzled welder in his 50s, said workers were ready to take up weapons and join the fight.

""If we have to, when the materials run out, we will make spears and we will throw those spears at them.""",https://en.as.com/en/2022/03/03/latest_news/1646329707_055129.html
4,69e41b55-fd28-4353-b99c-df71fb4f8f5a,"['Steve Balestrieri', 'Written By']",2022-03-03 13:05:53+00:00,"The 40-mile long convoy of Russian troops heading for Kyiv from the north has been stalled due to fuel problems, while senior Russian military officials have the convoy regrouping while apparently changing their strategy as they meet heavier resistance than expected.

The Russians are moving to surround and pressure Kyiv as they want to remove the standing Ukrainian government and install a puppet regime that will be loyal to the Putin regime in Moscow. But there are numerous reports of Russian conscript soldiers surrendering without firing a shot, and abandoning their equipment.

The convoy is still reported in the same position that it was on Monday evening, about 17-18 miles north of Kyiv. A senior defense official told Military Times that the convoy is stalled for a number of reasons. “Obviously, the resistance that they’re facing, the fuel and sustainment problems that they’re having. We are also picking up signs that they’re having problems feeding their troops, that they’re not only running out of gas, but they are running out of food.”

Ukrainian Brigadier General Kyrylo Budanov told Military Times that the Ukrainian Air Force is using this halt to conduct airstrikes using Su-25 and Su-24 ground attack aircraft as well as artillery and missile attacks on the stalled convoy.

“We burn many columns of the enemy,” he said, adding that “my intelligence officers and agents are directing and calling the strikes.”

Russians Accused of Using Thermobaric Weapons, Surrounding Mariupol

Budanov added that the Russians had used thermobaric weapons as they have increased their bombing of civilian areas and infrastructure as they try to weaken Ukraine’s ability to resist.

While the Russian Ministry of Defense has repeatedly denied the targeting of civilian areas, the videos that keep surfacing from Kharkiv and Kyiv show the widespread and indiscriminate shelling of dense civilian areas and apartment buildings.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine’s resolve has not been lost, despite the bombing. “They wanted to destroy us so many times. They couldn’t. We’ve been through so much! And if someone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken, or surrender — he knows nothing about Ukraine, and he has nothing to do in Ukraine,” Zelensky said in his daily video to Ukrainian citizens. “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom.”

While Russian troops have entered the center of the city of Kherson in the south and have apparently taken the city, although Ukrainian authorities maintain that there is fighting still ongoing in the city of over 300,000. It would be the first major city captured by the Russians. Meanwhile, Russian forces have moved to encircle the port city of Mariupol. If they were to capture it, it would link Russian forces in the Crimea, with the separatist-held areas in the Donbas.

They conducted a seaborne amphibious landing to seize Mariupol but chose a spot about 40 miles from the city, which gave the Ukrainian military forces time to prepare.

Putin Cracks Down On Free Speech Inside Russia

The Russian authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin is moving toward removing any narrative that isn’t coming from the Kremlin. After their coverage of the war in Ukraine differed from the one-sided view being broadcast from the government-run sites, Echo Radio was removed from the air by the government.

Echo Radio was a rare liberal radio station that popped up in the euphoria of post-Soviet Union freedom. The Russian government blocked the Echo website and asked Google to remove the app from its sites, and took the station off the air for what it said was the spreading of “deliberately false information” about the war in Ukraine.

The New York Times reported that the government also blocked the website of Dozhd, the country’s last remaining independent television channel. Fearing arrest by Russian security officials, the staff of Dozhd fled the country.

Russian lawmakers are expected to propose new draconian laws which will silence all reporting other than the official narrative of the fighting in Ukraine,

In every war, some images become iconic. So far in the Ukrainian war, the MAXAR satellite photos of Russian vehicles lined up for “40 miles” along the PO2, T1019 and T1011 highways north of the Hostomel Airport outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv have made headlines around the world.

The photos of highways clogged with Russian invasion forces have prompted armchair experts on social media to post memes of the A-10 Warthog with “BRRRRRRT!” scrawled across them. The Facebook “experts” suggest a few A-10s could just roll in and use their GAU-8 30mm cannons and AGM-65 Maverick missiles to decimate the Russian vehicle column. “That’s what I told my wife!” one of the posts read.

But according to current A-10 pilots, there’s only one problem, “It’s not that easy”. An Air National Guard A-10C Thunderbolt II pilot told TheAviationist.com. “It has to be a pretty permissive environment for us to just roll in and do a gun run. That doesn’t happen much anymore.”

Even before the Russians crossed the border into Ukraine, defense and aerospace analyst David Axe wrote in Forbes magazine that, “If Russia invades Ukraine, its front-line air-defenses will be the most dangerous in the world”. Axe went on to say in his January 10, 2022 article, “If that Russian army rolls in, a whole lot of additional MANPADS and SAM vehicles will come with it. They, combined with longer-range SAMs on the Russian side of the border, could force the Ukrainian army in Donbas to fight without the benefit of any aerial support”.

While some of Axe’s analysis hasn’t been entirely accurate – the Ukrainians have gotten some combat aircraft in the air- they have already suffered the loss of one of their most celebrated combat pilots, Col. Oleksandr Oksanchenko, who was shot down in his Sukhoi by a Russian S-400 Triumph surface-to-air missile (SAM) near Kyiv on Friday, Feb. 25, 2022.

And even though recent upgrades to A-10C Thunderbolt II have improved its targeting and communications capabilities, the A-10 was built to fight a very different war than the one we are seeing now in Ukraine.

The A-10 was originally conceived to offset a massive imbalance in the number of tanks between the Soviet-backed Warsaw Pact and the NATO alliance.

Strategists anticipated a huge flood of Russian tanks pouring through the Fulda Gap in Germany. At the height of the Cold War, the A-10 was intended to moderate that imbalance by providing a dedicated tactical anti-armor asset that could kill Soviet tanks. But although the A-10 was heavily armored with a titanium tub surrounding its cockpit, its prospects for survival even in the Soviet air defense era were poor due to a concentration of effective, highly mobile anti-aircraft weapons systems perfected by Russian suppliers in the real-world testing grounds of the Vietnam War and the many Arab-Israeli wars.

In his 1993 book, “Warthog: Flying the A-10 in the Gulf War”, author William H. Smallwood wrote about the dangers A-10 Thunderbolt II pilots faced when performing close air support missions over Iraq. Smallwood quoted A-10 pilot Capt. Tom Dean as saying:

“I myself figured that, knowing the number and kind of SAMs [surface-to-air missiles] the Iraqis had, that if we ever went to war, 20 to 25 percent of us were not coming back.”

Capt. Dean related one of his missions in Iraq to Smallwood:

“I rolled in and as I was strafing the target I started taking AAA [Anti-Aircraft Artillery fire]- heavy AAA. I was diving at about a 60-degree dive angle – and this was my near-death experience. I saw what appeared to me to be a fireball come by my canopy. It was either heavy AAA going by or a missile…”

Going back as far as the Vietnam conflict, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, a supersonic aircraft designed for high-speed medium and low level nuclear strike missions, suffered withering losses over North Vietnam, a country protected by a Soviet designed air defense network. According to researcher Rebecca Grant of AirForceMag.com, “The cumulative totals were shocking: The Air Force lost 40 percent of its total production of F-105s to combat in Vietnam.” And it was nearly as bad for the iconic F-4 Phantom II. Grant writes, “Approximately one out of every eight F-4s ever built by McDonnell Douglas—for all services—was destroyed in Vietnam”.

And remember, these losses were to early Soviet Bloc air defense systems supplied to the North Vietnamese and almost always crewed by North Vietnamese, although intelligence suggested Soviet “advisors” also played an active role in the air defense of North Vietnam.

In the post-Vietnam era, U.S. strike doctrine improved exponentially with the introduction of “stealth” or low radar observability when the F-117 Night Hawk, the “stealth fighter”, was introduced. For a decade, the F-117 “stealth fighter” operated with near-impunity against sophisticated Soviet-bloc air defenses during precision, low observable strikes. In December, 1989, during Operation Just Cause in Panama, U.S. F-117s dropped laser-guided bombs next to a Panamanian barracks as a diversionary strike. And in the F-117’s greatest performance on January 17, 1991, the stealth fighter brought “shock and awe” to downtown Baghdad, Iraq in the opening hours of Operation Desert Storm.

But even this temporary immunity to Soviet-designed air defense systems was fleeting. On March 27, 1999, the Yugoslav 3rd Battalion of the 250th Air Defense Missile Brigade shot down a USAF F-117 Nighthawk with an S-125 Neva/Pechora surface-to-air missile (SAM) outside Budanovci, Serbia in Yugoslavia. Russian air defense doctrine had achieved parity with U.S. stealth technology.

It’s important to understand that the A-10 Thunderbolt II first flew a half century ago in early 1972. It wasn’t until almost a decade later in 1981 that the F-117 flew for the first time. In fact, it could be argued that the Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II actually has more in common with its WWII namesake, the propeller-driven Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, than it does with the current low-observable F-35 Lightning II that can strike a vehicle column with impunity from a distance using precision stand-off weapons.

And while the cost of hitting a $10-20,000 USD Russian truck with a $25,000-plus precision guided JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) seems high, remember, it costs between $5-million and $10-million USD to train a U.S. Air Force pilot.

Consider that 31 years have passed between the first flights of the WWII P-47 Thunderbolt and today’s A-10 Thunderbolt II. But 34 years have passed between the first flight of the A-10 Thunderbolt II and the current F-35 Lightning II. And, during this entire time, the Russians have been perfecting the capability to shoot down western aircraft at test sites in Russia and real-world battlefields from Cuba to Africa, the Middle East, Indo-China and the Arctic.

So, while we all love the A-10 Thunderbolt II, she is better off in the asymmetrical global war on terror than she is in this new super-power slugfest in Ukraine, even though that reality ruins a lot of social media defense experts’ memes.",https://theaviationist.com/2022/03/03/a-10-ukraine/

The armoured column threatening Kyiv is bogged down around 30km (19 miles) from the centre of the city, having been slowed by Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion, with vehicles becoming stuck in mud and shortages of food, water and fuel.

""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,"" the MoD said in an intelligence update.

“The column has made little discernible progress in over three days.

An unnamed US defence official briefing on the situation near Kyiv concurred, saying the 40-mile-long Russian column containing hundreds of tanks and other vehicles still appeared to be roughly 25km from the city and had barely gained any ground in days.

Satellite imagery provided by Maxar showed Russia was sending further columns of troops and vehicles to strengthen its advances on key cities including Kyiv.

In Borodyanka, a small town 60 km, northwest of Kyiv, locals had repelled a Russian assault, and Reuters reported that burnt out hulks of destroyed Russian armour were scattered on a road.

""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again.

“We burn many columns of the enemy,” he said, using Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets and other ground-based weapons.

Elsewhere, Russian forces continued to make slow but steady gains, capturing the southern city of Kherson and bringing heavy fighting to the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol.

Days later, they're still waiting.

On Thursday, US intelligence suggested that the convoy was still stalled some distance from Kyiv, backing claims made by both the Ukrainian government and UK's defense ministry.

""We still assess that the convoy that everybody's been focused on is stalled. We have no reason to doubt Ukrainian claims that they have, that they have contributed to it being stalled by attacking it,"" a senior US official told reporters.

Earlier in the day, the UK's defense ministry said the convoy appears to have stalled some 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Kyiv and had made ""little discernible progress"" over the past three days, citing intelligence.

""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30 km from the center of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" the UK statement said.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday night that while the convoy and Russia's broader push towards Kyiv ""remains stalled,"" there was a significant concern ""that maybe the window is closing to be able to get aid into cities that may become under siege.""

A senior US defense official told reporters on that although the convoy is suffering shortages of fuel and food, the US has assessed that the Russians ""will again learn from these missteps and these stumbles and will try to overcome them.""

The convoy's stalled progress could create multiple strategic problems for Russia.

First, as the key Russian supply line for any major assault on Kyiv, it is a very large sitting target for Ukrainian forces fighting back against the invasion.

Second, sitting in a 40-mile-long traffic jam for days at a time could take its toll on the morale and discipline of Russian soldiers ahead of a major military operation.

Martti Kari, who previously served as Finland's assistant chief of defense intelligence, told CNN that being stranded like this is bad for morale for two reasons. ""First, the Ukrainians have drones and aircraft that could attack the convoy. Second, when you sit around in the same place rumors circulate that affect your mindset. So you become nervous and tired, which is not a good combination.""

Satellite images from Maxar Technologies show the convoy on February 28.

The convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus , a key ally of Putin where Russia had moved huge numbers of troops in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn't leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Wednesday night that the fierce Ukrainian resistance had dented Russian morale.

""More and more occupiers are fleeing back to Russia, from us, from you ... we are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week — plans those have been built for years,"" he said in a Facebook post.

The latest assessments on the convoy comes after the Russian military issued its first casualty figures from the war, saying 498 of its troops had died and another 1,597 had been injured. The UK statement on Thursday said ""the actual number of those killed and wounded will almost certainly be considerably higher and continue to rise.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed ""great sorrow"" over Russian military casualties on Thursday morning.

But Russia appeared to be meeting less resistance in southern Ukraine , where the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/russian-convoy-stalled-outside-kyiv-intl/index.html
