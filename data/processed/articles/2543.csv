Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit out at Russia claiming his country survived world wars, famines, holocaust, occupation of Crimea and vowed to rebuild the country after the war. Russia will compensate Ukraine for all the damages it suffered, he said.

Zelenskyy said, ""We have survived two world wars, three famines, the Holocaust, Babyn Yar, the Great Purge, the Chornobyl explosion, the occupation of Crimea, and the war in the east of our state.""

He also vowed to rebuild Ukraine after the war. We will restore every house, every street, every city, Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service claimed that more than 2,000 civilians have died since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

Zelenskyy said, ""They wanted to destroy us so many times, but they couldn't. We've been through so much. And if someone thinks that after overcoming all this, Ukrainians, all of us, will be scared, broken, or surrender, he just doesn't know anything about us. He [Putin] knows nothing about Ukraine.""

In a recent address to the nation, Zelenskyy had said, ""Ukrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. They will be destroyed everywhere.""

The Ukrainian military has mounted an unexpectedly fierce defense against invading Russian forces, which have been dogged by logistical problems and flagging morale. But the war is barely two weeks old, and in Washington and European capitals, officials anticipate that the Russian military will reverse its early losses, setting the stage for a long, bloody insurgency.

The ways that Western countries would support a Ukrainian resistance are beginning to take shape. Officials have been reluctant to discuss detailed plans, since they’re premised on a Russian military victory that, however likely, hasn’t happened yet. But as a first step, Ukraine’s allies are planning how to help establish and support a government-in-exile, which could direct guerrilla operations against Russian occupiers, according to several U.S. and European officials.

The weapons the United States has provided to Ukraine’s military, and that continue to flow into the country, would be crucial to the success of an insurgent movement, officials said. The Biden administration has asked Congress, infused with a rare bipartisan spirit in defense of Ukraine, to take up a $10 billion humanitarian aid and military package that includes funding to replenish the stocks of weapons that have already been sent.

Should the United States and its allies choose to back an insurgency, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be the pivotal force, officials said, maintaining morale and rallying Ukrainians living under Russian occupation to resist their powerful and well-equipped foe.

The possible Russian takeover of Kyiv has prompted a flurry of planning at the State Department, Pentagon and other U.S. agencies in the event that the Zelensky government has to flee the capital or the country itself.

“We’re doing contingency planning now for every possibility,” including a scenario in which Zelensky establishes a government-in-exile in Poland, said a U.S. administration official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive security matter.

Zelensky, who has called himself Russia’s “target No. 1,” remains in Kyiv and has assured his citizens he’s not leaving. He has had discussions with U.S. officials about whether he should move west to a safer position in the city of Lviv, closer to the Polish border. Zelensky’s security detail has plans ready to swiftly relocate him and members of his cabinet, a senior Ukrainian official said. “So far, he has refused to go.”

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, declined to describe any contingency plans Ukraine was making in the event that Russian forces capture the capital.

“One can only say that Ukraine is preparing for the defense of Kyiv as purposefully as Russia is preparing for its attack on Kyiv,” Podolyak said.

“This war has become a people’s war for Ukrainians,” he continued. “We must win the war. There are no other options.”

Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Ukraine’s parliament from the opposition European Solidarity party, expressed confidence that the Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, would continue to be able to meet despite the wartime situation and noted that many lawmakers remain in Kyiv.

“In our party, we didn’t discuss any plan of evacuation, because we don’t want to give up,” Ariev said. “We are not in this government, but we have arms, and we will fight against invaders here, together with the people. This is the only plan we have — no evacuation, nothing.”

Nevertheless, European diplomats, like their American counterparts, are starting to prepare for how to support the Ukrainian government if Kyiv falls or the country is entirely occupied by Russia. A United Nations resolution this past week condemning the invasion, which drew 141 votes, is one element of “laying the groundwork” to recognize Zelensky’s administration as Ukraine’s legitimate government and to keep it afloat even if it no longer controls territory, said a senior European diplomat.

“We haven’t made a plan yet, per se, but it would be something we would be ready to move on right away,” the diplomat said. “In our experience, it helps to know generally you have international support.”

As early as last December, some U.S. officials saw signs that the Ukrainian military was preparing for an eventual resistance, even as Zelensky downplayed the threat of invasion.

During an official visit, a Ukrainian special operations commander told Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and other lawmakers that they were shifting training and planning to focus on maintaining an armed opposition, relying on insurgent-like tactics.

Ukrainian officials told the lawmakers that they were frustrated that the United States had not sent Harpoon missiles to target Russian ships and Stinger missiles to attack Russian aircraft, Moulton and Waltz said in separate interviews. The United States diverted some military aid to Ukraine that it had planned to send to Afghanistan, but that package mostly included small arms, ammunition and medical kits meant for a fight against the Taliban, not Russia, said Waltz, who served in Afghanistan as a Special Forces officer.

As the Russian military struggles with logistical challenges — including fuel and food shortages — Waltz anticipates that the Ukrainians will repeatedly strike Russian supply lines. To do that, they need a steady supply of weapons and the ability to set improvised explosive devices, he said.

“Those supply lines are going to be very, very vulnerable, and that’s where you really literally starve the Russian army.”

Moulton, who served in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer, said that he is in favor of sending Harpoons and Stingers — the administration has decided to send the latter weapons, according to a U.S. official and a document obtained by The Washington Post — but that using them also will require training.

“You can’t ship them to Ukraine at the last minute and expect some national guardsman to pick up a Stinger and shoot down an aircraft,” he said. Continuing a resistance campaign will require continued clandestine shipments of small arms, ammunition, explosives and even cold-weather gear.

“Think about the kinds of things that would be used by saboteurs as opposed to an army repelling a frontal invasion,” Moulton said.

Officials remain cautious about overt support for a Ukrainian insurgency lest it draw NATO member countries into direct conflict with Russia. In Moscow’s eyes, support for a Zelensky government operating in Poland could constitute an attack by the alliance, some officials warned.

But Ukraine’s leaders and its citizens aren’t likely to be deterred by NATO’s concerns.

“I doubt very much that the Ukrainians will not continue an underground resistance campaign even after the Russians establish control,” said a senior Western intelligence official.

Moscow has “grossly underestimated Ukraine’s ability to resist,” the official said. “I’m reminded, especially by my eastern colleagues, about Ukrainians themselves. Ukrainians were some of the fiercest fighters … for the Soviets during World War II.” He predicted that a resistance would continue for months and possibly years.

The United States has backed and fought against successful insurgencies. Veterans of such conflicts say that the Ukrainians so far have demonstrated the key ingredient.

“The number one thing you have to have is people on the ground who want to fight,” said Jack Devine, a retired senior CIA officer who ran the agency’s successful covert campaign to arm Afghan fighters who drove out the Soviet military in the 1980s.

If Russian and Ukrainian negotiators who have been meeting near the border in Belarus reach some settlement, that will likely diminish the momentum for an insurgency and support for it, Devine predicted.

Marta Kepe, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corp. who studies resistance movements, said that they often change during the course of a war.

“As occupation progresses and extends for a longer time, what can start out as a more centralized resistance often changes into smaller resistance groups or units. It is not a negative thing,” she said. “In fact, smaller groups allow more resilience.”

NATO policymakers admire the spirit of the Ukrainian forces, but they also say that their ability to hold out against Russia is not unlimited, especially as stocks of ammunition dwindle and the Russian military extends its encirclement of major cities.

“Russia has more troops than Ukraine,” said a second senior European diplomat. “Ukrainian troops are very brave, but they are already fighting more than a week.”

Experts in resistance and urban warfare said Russian occupation forces will try to squeeze supply pipelines and cut off cities.

Rita Konaev, director of analysis for Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said Ukraine should be preparing its citizens for combat in cities accompanied by mass air and artillery bombardment, which Russia will use to try to reduce the amount of door-to-door fighting that taking cities requires.

Konaev said that Ukrainians should also lay in supplies in advance, because Russian forces will likely disable the electrical grid and cut off access to water in the cities, and that they should establish safe areas underground to survive the aerial bombardment.

Once Russian forces try to move into the cities, Ukrainians will have an advantage because they know the terrain, she said. They can build barriers, destroy bridges to limit entrances into the city, and place snipers on rooftops.

“In urban warfare, defense has the advantage,” Konaev said.

European leaders have been trying to game out what Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept as a potential end state for a defeated Ukraine. Policymakers say they don’t have a clear sense, although the first European diplomat said that Putin might attempt to reduce Ukraine “to a much smaller state.”

Under that scenario, western Ukraine would remain independent. The other territories would be incorporated into Russia, occupied, or declared independent states, as the Kremlin has already done with the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

But Russia’s ability to impose that vision is “most improbable,” the diplomat said, given the profound anger in Ukraine against the Russian invasion.

“This is a country of 40 million [people],” the diplomat said. The Kremlin “can try to have a strategy. But I think in our strategic calculations we are always forgetting one small obstacle, and that’s the will of the people. Putin has forgotten how to be elected in a democratic way.”

NATO leaders also say that even if Russia captures Kyiv, that would not end the resistance, nor the existence of the Ukrainian state.

“Russians cannot occupy all the country and subdue it,” said Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks, whose country maintained a diplomatic service in exile for 51 years after it was occupied in 1940 by the Soviet Union. Washington never recognized the annexation of the three Baltic states.

“There will be a partisan war, there will be resistance. So even if Kyiv falls, that does not mean the end of the war,” Pabriks said.

The Russian advance on Kyiv remained largely stalled on Friday while a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant was extinguished following a Kremlin attack that drew worldwide condemnation.

Other Russian offensives were pushing ahead. An armed force in southern Ukraine made significant gains in an attempt to cut off access to the sea.

The attack on the Zaporizhzhia power plant facility caused a fire and widespread fears of a disaster similar to the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which occurred about 65 miles north of the Ukrainian capital. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine tweeted, ""If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl!""

There were no indications of radiation leaking, according to a senior U.S. Defense Department official. Nuclear power plants are not designed to withstand military attacks, underscoring the recklessness of the assault, added the official, who discussed intelligence reports on condition of anonymity.

The Russians apparently captured the plant with an eye toward controlling the Ukrainian population, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said. Operating the plant would allow them to deliver power, or to withhold it to punish Ukrainians.

At an emergency Security Council meeting after the attack, Ukraine’s U.N. ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of committing ""an act of nuclear terrorism.""

He told the council his Russian counterpart was lying over a claim that a “Ukrainian sabotage group” was responsible for setting fire to a training facility at the plant. He said several buildings were damaged and one part of the facility was experiencing an outage.

Meanwhile, the Russian advance on the capital of Kyiv remained largely stalled about 15 miles from the city center, the official said. Ukrainian forces have hindered its progress by blowing up a key bridge and attacking vehicles in the convoy that stretches for 40 miles. Though bogged down, the Russians continue to shell Ukrainian cities, striking residential areas and civilian infrastructure, the official said.

Russia reports ceasefire in two areas of Ukraine

The Russian military will observe a ceasefire in two areas of Ukraine starting Saturday to allow civilians to evacuate, Russian state media reported, but there was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. It would be the first breakthrough in allowing civilians to escape the war.

The Russian Defense Ministry statement said it has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave the strategic port of Mariupol in the southeast and the eastern town of Volnovakha “from 10 a.m. Moscow time.” It was not immediately clear from the vaguely worded statement how long the routes would remain open.

The head of Ukraine’s security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting, calling such corridors “question No. 1.”

Italy detains oligarch's yacht in sanctions crackdown

A billionaire's superyacht was detained Friday by Italian authorities in furtherance of European Union sanctions levied against oligarchs stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

According to the Bloomberg, a 215-foot vessel named ""Lady M,"" owned by Alexei Mordashov, was docked in Imperia, a Ligurian Sea port near the French border.

Mordashov is among six Russians who were targeted for sanctions on Monday by the European Union. He is the primary shareholder and chairman of Severstal, a Russian company, with holdings in television, energy and mining, and was recently listed by Forbes as the second-wealthiest person in Russia. Earlier this week, he told the Russian news agency, TASS, he did not understand why he's been targeted, claiming he has ""absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension.”

Former Vice President Mike Pence told Republicans “there is no room in this party for apologists for Putin” during an event with the party's top donors.

Pence directed his comments toward members of the GOP who have failed to take Russian President Vladimir Putin to task for his brutal assault on Ukraine. Pence urged the party to move on from the 2020 presidential election.

“Where would Russian tanks be today if NATO had not expanded the borders of freedom? There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin,” Pence said. “There is only room for champions of freedom.”

Sky News journalists fired on by Russian forces

A British news team in Kyiv came under fire this week from what they reported was a Russian ""death squad"" as they attempted to cover the war in Ukraine's capital.

Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsey was wounded during the ambush and a camera operator took two bullets to his body armor despite repeatedly identifying themselves as media.

A harrowing video of the incident shows the five-person crew motoring along a deserted, war-torn street when their vehicle is disabled by an explosion. Gunfire erupts and the windshield is shattered as they repeatedly cry out, ""Press!""

""Somehow, we've got to get out of there, but the bullets keep coming,"" Ramsey says on the video. Shots continue for nearly three minutes before the journalists manage to escape down an embankment and into a nearby warehouse. Sky News' website does not identify the date of the incident or the severity of Ramsey's wound but says team members have returned safely to the United Kingdom.

VP Harris to travel next week to Poland and Romania

Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to Poland and Romania to demonstrate NATO strength and unity and show U.S. support for the alliance’s eastern flank in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Harris will travel next Wednesday through Friday to Warsaw and Bucharest for meetings with the leaders of Poland and Romania. The leaders are expected to discuss continuing support for the people of Ukraine through security, economic and humanitarian assistance and the decision to impose severe economic consequences on Russia and those complicit in the invasion, the vice president’s office said.

“The vice president’s meetings will also focus on how the United States can further support Ukraine’s neighbors as they welcome and care for refugees fleeing violence,” Harris’ spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said.

Biden examining ban on Russian oil as pressure builds

The White House said Friday it was weighing a ban on Russian oil imports amid growing bipartisan calls for President Joe Biden to sanction Russia’s energy sector as Vladimir Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.

“We are looking at options we could take right now to cut U.S. consumption of Russian energy,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “But we are very focused on minimizing the impact of families. If you reduce supply in the global marketplace, you are going to rise raise gas prices.”

By leaving open a ban on Russian oil imports, the White House softened its stance from Thursday when Psaki rejected the idea for being against the “strategic interest” of the U.S.

Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Thursday introduced the Ban Russian Energy Imports Act, which would prohibit the importation of Russian crude oil, petroleum, liquefied natural as and coal from Russia. The legislation has 16 additional Senate co-sponsors spanning both parties.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she also supports the bill. “I’m all for that. Ban it,” the speaker said Thursday.

In 2021, the U.S. imported an average of 209,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia, according to the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, accounting for 3% of all U.S. crude oil imports and 1 percent of the total crude oil produced by American refineries.

US does not advocate for killing Vladimir Putin, White House says

White House press secretary Jen Psaki categorically rejected an idea posed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham that implied someone in Russia should assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""No, we are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change,” Psaki said during a press briefing. “That is not the policy of the United States.""

In his tweet, Graham called for someone to “take this guy out,” in reference to Putin and said it would be a ""great service"" to Russia and the world at large.

""That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you'd hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,"" Psaki told reporters.

Vladimir Putin outlaws spread of 'fake' news against Russia's position

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill introducing a prison sentence of up to 15 years for spreading information that goes against the Russian government’s position on the war in Ukraine.

The bill criminalizing the intentional spreading of what Russia deems to be “fake” reports about the war was quickly rubber-stamped by both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament earlier Friday.

The new law led to a a slew of prominent outlets announcing the suspension of the work of its journalists in the country, including CNN, Bloomberg News, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the BBC.

""The legislation appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism,"" Tim Davis, BBC's publications director said. ""It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspect the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development.""

Russian authorities have repeatedly decried reports of Russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in Ukraine as “fake” reports. State media outlets refer to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” rather than a “war” or “invasion.”

The law includes sentences of up to three years or fines for spreading what authorities deem to be false news about the military, but the maximum punishment rises to 15 years for cases deemed to have led to “severe consequences.”

Russia blocks access to Facebook, Twitter in country

Russia's media regulator made back-to-back announcements Friday that it was blocking access to both Facebook and Twitter across the country.

The news came amid a crackdown on media sources in Russia as the country passed a law allowing for 15-year prison sentences for intentionally spreading “fake” information about military action.

Russian communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said it cut access to Facebook over its alleged “discrimination” of the Russian media and state information resources. It said the restrictions introduced by Facebook owner Meta on the RT and other state-controlled media violate Russian law.

The agency followed up with cutting access to Twitter to be in line with the Russian Prosecutor General’s office decision. The watchdog has previously accused Twitter of failing to delete the content banned by the Russian authorities and slowed down access to it.

""We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action,"" said Nick Clegg, president for global affairs for Facebook's parent company Meta.

Clegg said Monday the company wasn't pulling its platforms from Russia on its own accord because Russian people were using them to protest the war. Clegg said Russia had been ""throttling"" the platform, though, to prevent protests.

1.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine, UN says

More than 1.2 million refugees have fled from Ukraine since the conflict began, the United Nations' refugee agency said Friday.

Thursday, more than 165,000 people left the country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Most leaving are women, children and older people , said spokesperson Shabia Mantoo, and the majority are fleeing to Poland, though others have gone to Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania. Some have also fled to Russia and Belarus.

However, an increasing number of reports indicate people of color fleeing Ukraine are facing discrimination at the border. The crisis highlights a double standard in the way nations treat refugees based on country of origin, race, religion and more, academics and refugees say. Many of the same European nations that turned away refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia in the past are now largely welcoming refugees from Ukraine.

Zelenskyy blasts NATO over refusal to implement no-fly zone

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a defiant and emotional speech, condemned NATO over its refusal to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said the move would only embolden Russia.

“All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” he said in a nighttime address. “The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.”

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday the military organization would not implement a no-fly zone or place troops on the ground in Ukraine over fears it could provoke widespread war throughout Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.

""Allies agree that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,"" Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels after chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, describing it as a ""painful decision.""

Stoltenberg said bringing NATO troops or planes to Ukraine would only further escalate the conflict and bring about more destruction. ""If we did that, we'd end up with something that that could end in a full fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering,"" he added.

UN Human Rights Council to set up panel for Ukraine

A three-person expert panel will monitor potential human rights violations in Ukraine after an overwhelming vote from the United Nation's Human Rights Council.

The U.N.'s top human rights body voted 32-2, with 13 abstentions, to create the international panel. Only Russia and Eritrea opposed the resolution, with China abstaining.

In a tweet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the creation of the panel, saying, ""Russian war criminals will be held accountable.""

International law experts have raised concerns about war crimes, including the targeting of civilians, and the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, which is separate from the U.N., said earlier this week he was also opening an investigation.

Western leaders condemn Russian attacks at Ukraine power plant

The office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will seek an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting after Russian troops in Ukraine attacked a nuclear power plant and sparked a fire.

Johnson’s office says he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the early hours of the morning. He says Britain will raise the issue immediately with Russia and close partners.

“The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe,” Johnson’s office said in a statement. “He said (the United Kingdom) would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further.”

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he also spoke with Zelenskyy about the attacks on the power plant.

“These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately,” he said on Twitter.

China also said it is “seriously concerned about the safety and security” of nuclear facilities in Ukraine.

Ukrainians in US granted temporary protection from deportation

The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced temporary protected status (TPS) for Ukrainians living in the United States, which will shield them from deportation for the next 18 months, as Ukraine battles ongoing attacks from Russia.

“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”

Individuals must have continuously lived in the U.S. since March 1 to be eligible for TPS, DHS said. That would apply to approximately 30,000 Ukrainian nationals. Those who attempt to travel to the U.S. after March 1 do not qualify for TPS.

Russian forces have seized a Ukraine nuclear power plant and are advancing on a second, about 75 miles north of the city of Mykolaiv — raising concerns about nuclear safety.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We travel next to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant. The world watched last week as Russians took control of one such plant in Ukraine. Fire broke out on the site as combat raged nearby. Other plants remain in Ukrainian government control. And NPR's Tim Mak visited one.

TIM MAK, BYLINE: The northern part of Rivne Oblast near the Belarussian border is a harsh place in winter. A light snow is falling as we enter the town of Varash, past concrete checkpoints and guards, some jumpier than others. Densely wooded areas crowd the road on both sides until, after a turn, these enormous structures appear on the horizon.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're approaching a nuclear plant (laughter).

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We are approaching a nuclear plant.

MAK: They're gargantuan cooling towers, billowing steam into the sky. A plant spokesman says we're the first reporters to visit the Rivne nuclear plant site since the invasion. It's one of just three and the largest currently under Ukrainian control after the Russians attacked and took over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear site in southeastern Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Non-English language spoken).

MAK: Just 700 meters down the road from the Rivne nuclear reactors, we spoke with Pavlo Pavlyshyn, the director general of the station. I asked him whether he could guarantee the security and safety of the site.

PAVLO PAVLYSHYN: (Through interpreter) If more sophisticated weapons will be used against us, I think no one can assure the safety, but we are ready for it as well.

MAK: Though he did note that the Russians and Belarussians have made no moves towards the site and that his team was ready for any eventuality. He started the interview quietly, but the emotion, the toll of these last days of war appears to have been grinding on him as he talks about Russian nuclear scientists, people he considered his friends.

PAVLYSHYN: (Through interpreter) They don't have to keep it silent. Why do they keep it silent? Why do they just keep watching us? The war is really happening. Innocent children are really dying.

MAK: He says that the Russian military, which has captured Zaporizhzhia and the now decommissioned Chernobyl site, is specifically trying to target nuclear power sites. A senior Ukrainian military official, Ihor Voronchenko, agrees with this assessment in an interview.

IHOR VORONCHENKO: (Through interpreter) This is a means for blackmailing and threatening us. Putin will threaten us with these nuclear plants, and they won't use the nuclear weapon, but they will threaten to turn Zaporizhzhia into the next Chernobyl.

MAK: We also spoke to Vitaliy Koval, the governor of this region. Nuclear safety is on his mind daily.

VITALIY KOVAL: (Through interpreter) We know how important it is to have nuclear safety and everything because we remember Chernobyl. We felt the consequences of the Chernobyl accident in our region. Four districts were contaminated by nuclear energy. That was a problem.

MAK: Pavlo Pavlyshyn, the director general, says that if the Russians do attempt to take the Rivne nuclear power plant, he fully expects the Ukrainian military will put up a fight. As we talk, the director general shares what he's telling his family, especially his 26-year-old son.

PAVLYSHYN: (Through interpreter) To run somewhere or to hide is just meaningless. I don't want to go back to where I was. I want to live freely for my kids, for my grandkids. I want them to be able to travel to Europe, get education, speak freely.

MAK: As our conversation ends, he emphasizes to us that he's not a political person. He's a nuclear scientist. He's never been political. But right now, in the perilous situation he faces, that Ukrainians face, he says he cannot keep silent.

Tim Mak, NPR News, Rivne Oblast.

INSKEEP: We are following other news from the war, which is mostly news of things that have not happened.

DW investigative journalist lays out research on possible Russian war crimes

DW investigative journalist Lewis Sanders discussed his research into possible Russian war crimes in its invasion of Ukraine.

""For the past couple of days, we've been looking into an attack on a regional administrative building in the heart of Kharkiv, to be precise at Freedom Square. Now that attack left six people dead and dozens more wounded,"" Sanders said in an interview on DW's English channel. ""And if we look at the CCTV television TV footage, you can see that if you go in frame by frame, you can see the projectile right before impact.""

Watch video 05:27 DW's Lewis Sanders on mounting evidence of alleged war crimes in Ukraine

""With the help of military experts, we were able to identify the projectile as a Russian-made caliber cruise missile,"" Sanders continued. ""Now, why is that important? Well, cruise missiles, generally speaking, have multiple guidance systems as part of the system, which suggests that this could have been a targeted attack.""

He said that his team did not find any legitimate military targets in the area around Freedom Square.

""And so what is quite interesting is that we spoke to residents in the area and witnesses who told us that they had heard two explosions that morning, one at eight o'clock and one 10 minutes later,"" Sanders said.

He claimed that based on research into Russia's military actions in Syria, Russian forces typically target an area by attacking it twice. He said this suggests the attack at Freedom Square could have been deliberate by Russia.

In addition, he said the alleged use of cluster bombs and thermobaric weapons also suggest possible war crimes by Moscow, as they indiscriminately harm civilians.

Fridays for Future demand end to Russian energy imports

OSCE members set up mission to probe possible war crimes

Some 45 members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are triggering a system to set up a mission of experts looking into possible war crimes by Russia in Ukraine.

Podolyak said the talks would focus on pushing for a ""humanitarian corridor"" and an immediate cease-fire.

On Monday, the first round of talks yielded no breakthrough. Ukraine has said it would not accept any ""ultimatums"" by Russia, while Putin said Moscow could add further demands if Kyiv stalls the talks.

""Attempts to buy time by dragging out the negotiations only lead to additional demands on Kiyv in our negotiating position,"" Putin told French President Macron in a phone call on Thursday, according to a readout by the Kremlin.

According to French officials, the telephone call was initiated by Putin, who said his army's ""operation"" was going ""according to the plan"" that Moscow had.

""There was nothing in what President Putin said that could reassure us,"" a French presidential adviser told reporters, adding that Putin had reiterated his ""narrative"" that he was seeking the ""denazification of Ukraine.""

""'You are lying to yourself',"" Macron told Putin, according to the official. ""'It will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time'.""

Hungary objects to EU refugee protection proposal

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, said Budapest did not agree to a proposed scheme by the European Commission to provide temporary protection to people fleeing Ukraine.

Gulyas said the EU already had clear asylum rules in place, and that Hungary would grant refugee status to everyone fleeing Ukraine.

According to Gulyas, the Visegrad Four group, also including the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, jointly did not support the proposal by the European Commission.

The remarks came as EU interior ministers were meeting to discuss the proposed plan, which was widely expected to be approved.

German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said she hoped her counterparts would agree on the scheme soon. ""Today, it is about all EU members agreeing on a policy to be able to provide help in a non-bureaucratic way,"" she said.

The proposed measures would apply to Ukrainians and those with long-term residency or refugee status in Ukraine, sparing them from lengthy asylum procedures.

They would be granted temporary residence permits and access to the labor market and social welfare.

""The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" UK intelligence officials said.

Reports: Germany to send Soviet-era missiles to Ukraine

Berlin is preparing a shipment of 2,700 Soviet-era ""Strela"" missiles to Ukraine, according to government sources cited by news agencies. A source told the Reuters news agency that the missiles were ""ready to be transported"" but that the Federal Security Council has yet to approve the move.

The weapons would come out of the depots once overseen by Soviet-controlled East Germany, which reunited with West Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

Berlin has long refused to provide Ukraine with deadly weapons, but the policy was changed last week due to the Russian attack. Over the weekend, the German government decided to supply Ukraine with 500 US-made surface-to-air Stinger missiles and 1,000 anti-tank weapons.

Russian aviation, space industry firms to be blocked from London insurance market

The UK is preparing a ban for UK-based insurance providers from financial transactions with ""a Russian entity or for use in Russia,"" the British Treasury said in a statement.

The London insurance market is the world's largest commercial and specialty insurance center.

France urges its citizens to leave Russia

The French government has strongly urged its citizens to leave Russian territory if their presence is ""not essential"" to themselves or their families. The call comes three days after the US issued a similar appeal to American nationals.

Separately, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France 2 TV that Paris would float a cease-fire resolution in the UN Security Council on Thursday.

""I think it is possible that the worst is ahead of us,"" he told the broadcaster, commenting on the Russian attack.

""The Russians entered Ukraine looking for a blitzkrieg, a fast advance that would allow Russia to control Ukraine,"" according to Le Drian. With that strategy failing, Moscow could focus on besieging large cities.

""As forces build up around those cities we can fear a siege mentality,"" he said.

Russia's liberal Ekho Moskvy radio closes

One of the few remaining liberal radio stations in Russia, Ekho Moskvy, was dissolved by its board of directors after coming under intense state pressure over its reporting on the war in Ukraine.

The staton's editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov criticized the board's move.

""The decision to dissolve was made in 15 minutes, they didn't even invite me to the session,"" he told the Interfax news agency.

While the station is seen as independent in its reporting, it is also majority owned by Russian state energy giant Gazprom. Google has previously blocked the station on YouTube due to their Gazprom links.

The station was taken off the air in Russia on Tuesday, with Russian prosecutors claiming they were broadcasting fake news about the conflict. On Thursday, Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor requested Google to ban the Ekho Moskvy app from its store, citing breaches of Russian information law.

Russian, Belarusian athletes banned from Beijing Paralympics

The International Paralympics Committee (IPC) has decided to ban competitors from Russia and Belarus from the competition in Beijing which is due to start tomorrow.

Initially, the sports body said the athletes from those countries would be allowed to compete as ""neutrals"" with no anthem or flag, but it has since came under strong pressure to reverse the decision. According to the committee, many athletes signaled they would not compete against Russians and Belarusians, jeopardizing the event.

""In the last 12 hours, an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us,"" IPC president Andrew Parsons said in a statement. ""They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences.""

Parsons added: ""What is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games.""

Toyota halts production at St. Petersburg plant

Carmaking giant Toyota said it was stopping operations at its only Russian plant, located in St. Petersburg. The plant produced around 80,000 vehicles last year, most of which have been sold on the Russian market.

The Japanese-based company also said it has ""stopped imports of vehicles, until further notice, due to supply chain disruptions"" as Russia faces tough international sanctions.

Toyota has no factories in Ukraine but it had aready stopped all sales operations in that country when Russia launched the invasion last Thursday.

""As a company with operations in Ukraine and Russia, our priority in dealing with this crisis is to ensure the safety of all our team members, retailer staff, and supply chain partners,"" they said in a statement.

UAE offers visa on arrival for Ukrainians

The United Arab Emirates announced on Thursday it will be offering visas on arrival for Ukrainian citizens, as thousands flee the country.

The UAE reversed its previous decision to suspend visa waivers to Ukrainians, a move which had drawn criticism from its Western allies. The country also abstained from a UN Security Council resolution last week deploring the invasion. However, at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, all six Gulf Arab states supported a vote to reprimand Russia.

New talks scheduled, location unclear

Ukraine and Russia are expected to start another round of talks on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Russia's top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said the Russian delegation was waiting in southwestern Belarus, and that Ukrainian representatives were on their way. Medinsky also told Rossyia 24 broadcaster that Russian soldiers created a ""safety corridor"" for the Ukrainian delegations.

Belarus said the two sides would meet for talks in the ancient Bialowieza Forest on the border of Poland and Belarus, but a Ukrainian representative disputed this information, saying that ""negotiations will indeed happen,"" but in a different location.

The talks are expected on the cease-fire. The two sides met for their first round of talks on Monday, but the meeting produced no tangible results.

US: Russia in 'full assault on media freedom and the truth'

The US State Department said Russia launched a ""full assault on media freedom and the truth"" by blocking independent news media and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine.

""Russia's government is also throttling Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram platforms that tens of millions of Russia's citizens rely on to access independent information and opinions,"" the State Department said in a statement, adding that Russians relied on social media to contact each other and the outside world.

""The people of Russia did not choose this war. Putin did,"" the State Department statement said. ""They have a right to know about the death, suffering and destruction being inflicted by their government on the people of Ukraine. The people of Russia also have a right to know about the human costs of this senseless war to their own soldiers.""

Russian troops in Black Sea port city of Kherson

The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops were in the center of the city of Kherson after conflicting claims over whether Russian soldiers had captured a major urban center for the first time in its eight-day invasion.

Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.

""The occupiers are in all parts of the city and are very dangerous,"" Gennady Lakhuta, head of the regional administration, wrote on messaging service Telegram late Wednesday

US Congress passes resolution in support of Ukraine

The US House of Representatives approved a resolution ""steadfastly, staunchly, proudly and fervently"" in support of Ukraine. Many in Congress urged that more be done to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine.

Only three members of the House voted against the resolution: Republicans Paul Gosar of Arizona, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Matt Rosendale of Montana.

US Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is introducing a similar resolution in the Senate, the upper chamber.

On Tuesday night, members of both political parties in the US wore pins and waved the sky blue and sunflower yellow of the Ukrainian flag during US President Joe Biden's State of the Union address to both chambers.

More than 1 million refugees flee Ukraine

The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said more than 1 million people have fled Ukraine.

Grandi tweeted, ""In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries.""

The 1 million figure amounts to the displacement of more than 2% of Ukraine's population. As of 2020, World Bank figures showed Ukraine had a population of 44 million.

The UNHCR predicts up to 4 million people could make an exodus out of Ukraine, though with the caveat that this figure too could increase.

At this rate, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said that ""at this rate"" Ukraine could experience ""the biggest refugee crisis this century.""

German TV to broadcast benefit 'Concert for Peace'

German television will broadcast a soldout ""Concert for Peace"" to raise funds for humanitarian aid for the people of Ukraine. The concert is being organized by the Berlin State Opera with Staatskapelle Berlin star conductor Daniel Barenboim.

The concert and television event will be in the form of a matinee scheduled for Sunday. Proceeds will go to the UN Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UNHF).

The presidents of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, and the Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, will attend. Both central banks will make donations to the UNHF.

The Ukrainian national anthem, based on Pavlo Chubynsky's poem ""Ukraine Has Not Yet Perished,"" set to music by Michailo Werbizki, will be included along with symphonies by Schubert and Beethoven.

The Berlin State Opera said its management and staff were ""horrified, shocked and deeply concerned about the war that the Russian government has launched against Ukraine.""

ICC proceeds with war crimes inquiry in Ukraine

The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan QC announced he is opening an active investigation into war crimes occurring against the civilian population of Ukraine.

In a statement, Khan wrote, ""I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced.""

Thirty-nine signatories to the court's jurisdiction, including Germany, referred the situation in Ukraine to the ICC, speeding up the course by which it could act.

Russia is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the ICC.

UN records 752 civilian deaths in Ukraine

The UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) monitoring mission in Ukraine said it had recorded 752 deaths among Ukrainian civilians since the conflict began at 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) on February 24. An additional 525 have reportedly been injured during the war.

In a statement, the monitoring mission noted, ""This is more than the total number of civilian casualties recorded by OHCHR in the conflict zone of eastern Ukraine from 2018-2021,"" when 136 people were killed.

""Most of these casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and airstrikes,"" the UN body said.

The statement added that the UN ""believes that real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration.""

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Wednesday

The Russian military said it took control of the southern city of Kherson, yet both the Ukrainian military and Pentagon disputed the claim.

The UN registered 752 civilian deaths in Ukraine since the invasion began on February 28.

A member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation's (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission was killed during an attack on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

Russia claims 498 of its troops have been killed so far, a number far lower than Ukrainian estimates.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the war has ushered in a ""new era"" for Europe and urged the continent to take charge of its own security.

Meanwhile, US top diplomat Antony Blinken described the death toll in Ukraine as ""staggering"" and voiced support for a cease-fire. President Joe Biden vowed to ""inflict pain"" on Russian Vladimir Putin in his State of the Union address.

A vast majority of member states in the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution calling for Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. Russia, along with four other countries, voted against the measure.

Sky News asked military and defence experts to identify the key things we have learned so far - and what could happen next.

Follow live updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine

Russia was 'unprepared' and 'made a lot of mistakes'

Edward Arnold, a European security expert from the Royal United Services Institute, said the Russian military is ""not as modernised or prepared as we thought it might be"" which ""proved quite catastrophic"" for them.

He thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin did not trust his own people enough to tell soldiers what their objectives were.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:55 ‘No US troops on the ground’, says Kamala Harris

He believes Russia initially limited civilian casualties and the destruction of critical national infrastructure so they could govern better when they put another regime in place.

Mathieu Boulegue, an expert in Eurasian security and defence at Chatham House, said Russia ""made a lot of mistakes"".

The military's strategy of having smaller units moving in with ""absolutely no support"" left them ""very vulnerable to ambushes"", he said.

""After a botched first week, they are playing catch up with what they do best, which is what we are starting to see in Kyiv and Kharkiv: terror campaigns, shelling, bombardment, indiscriminate ammunition firing to terrorise populations and quickly seize territory,"" he said.

William Alberque, a former NATO official who is now director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said he expected the country to have used airstrikes for at least a week to gain control of the skies before sending in troops.

Another problem was that Russia used really poor communications equipment that was easily hacked, he said.

Edward Lucas, an expert on Russia, said he was surprised that Russia did not cripple the internet and mobile phone network - which is now helping Ukrainians spread their key messages.

Putin underestimated Ukrainian resistance

Russia was unprepared partly due to ""failed assumptions"", according to Mr Boulegue.

""They probably thought Ukrainians would just lay down their weapons and stop fighting,"" he said.

""They fell victim to their own narrative around the 'defensive justified war that aims to liberate or de-Nazify Ukraine'.""

But instead, Russian forces encountered a Ukrainian military that has improved its own capabilities since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Mr Lucas said.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:58 'How worried are you about President Zelenskyy?'

Mr Arnold said Ukrainians ""put up fierce resistance"" that crucially included arming civilians, not just armed forces.

Zelenskyy became a 'war hero' but also a 'single point of failure'

This was possible because Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy still has access to a functioning communications network that allows him to deliver ""Churchillian"" speeches to rally his own people as well as other world leaders, according to Mr Lucas.

Mr Boulegue said his public image has gone from being an ""okay president"" to a ""war hero"" who is ""standing up to Putin and fuelling Ukrainian patriotism and pride"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:10 'We will cry after our victory'

Rather than viewing his background as a comedian as a liability, Mr Arnold said it has been an advantage.

""He is an actor who's very good in front of a screen,"" he said, adding that his ""messaging is very clear"".

Mr Alberque said the West had thought Russia were ""ninjas in information warfare"" due to their interference in elections and previous disinformation campaigns - but he said they are ""losing the information war"" to Ukraine.

But Mr Zelenskyy is ""now becoming the single point of failure"", Mr Arnold warned.

""If Zelenskyy is either assassinated or removed through other means, there doesn't seem to be anyone who can take that mantle yet"", he said.

He said a key next move would be to work out a succession of command and have leaders who are not in Kyiv that could take over if needed.

West's biggest change in posture towards Russia in decades

Mr Lucas said the global response to the invasion has been ""astonishing"".

""We've seen more change in the West's posture towards Russia in the last five days than we have in the last 25 years,"" he said.

Mr Arnold said there have been the biggest ""seismic changes"" in European security policies in decades - such as German increasing its defence budget by €100bn and sending lethal aid, as well as Sweden and Finland no longer remaining neutral.

He does not think the support for Ukraine would have been as forthcoming if Russia had been more successful.

What could be next

Mr Boulegue said we will see probably see a ""terror campaign that is part of Russia's strategy to seize cities"" in the next few days.

Mr Lucas added that due to escalating violence ""thousands more people are going to die"" and ""hundreds of thousands will become refugees"", putting a ""huge strain"" on neighbouring countries like Moldova.

He suspects more ""nuclear sabre-rattling"" from Putin and for him to impose his own painful sanctions on the West.

He said Russians across the country are ""beginning to wonder what their sons who are conscripted are doing"" and ripples of public protest could turn into waves.

There are already defections and desertions from the army, which is ""clearly under a lot of strain with very low morale"", he said.

""There's a possibility of a palace coup where the people around Putin say, we don't want to go down with the boss so let's get the boss out,"" he said.

He expects more political and economic pressure on Belarus now that it has aligned itself with Russia.

Another focus will be for the West to make sure the weapons it is donating get into the hands of Ukrainians quickly, which will be a challenge, he said.

The State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a Facebook post that the Zaporizhzhia plant was being ""occupied by the military forces of the Russian Federation,"" according to an NBC News translation.

The occupation came after a fire in a training building at the plant, which triggered calls for troops to immediately retreat amid fears of nuclear danger.

The fire was declared to be out around 6:20 a.m. local time, and there were no victims, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement, according to an NBC News translation.

Units at the plant remained intact, the inspectorate said. Though there was damage to the reactor compartment of one unit, the damage did not affect the unit's safety, the office said.

There have been no changes in the radiation status at the plant, the inspectorate said.

The latest developments on Ukraine:

Ukraine and Russia tentatively agree to create humanitarian corridors that would allow for safe evacuations of civilians.

Biden administration offers temporary immigration status to Ukrainian citizens in the U.S.

Busloads of volunteers cross Polish border into Ukraine to help fight against Russian forces.

While the blaze burned, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said on Twitter that if the power plant blows up “it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl.”

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia,” Kuleba tweeted. “Fire has already broke out.”

He called for an immediate ceasefire in the vicinity of the plant.

Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant in Enerhodar, said in a video posted on Telegram that there “is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.”

The attack had prevented firefighters from immediately accessing the nuclear plant, the State Emergency Service said on Facebook, adding that rescuers were on standby.

The country’s emergency services department later said there was a fire in a training building behind the plant, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said no “essential” equipment had been damaged.

The agency added that there was no change in radiation levels at the site. The White House later said that its latest information showed ""no indications of elevated levels of radiation.""

President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the fire. In a summary of the call released by the White House, Biden urged Russia to stop military activities in the area so firefighters and emergency responders could get to the site.

The fresh tensions in Ukraine came just hours after a second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials ended with the two sides tentatively agreeing to establish humanitarian corridors for the safe evacuation of civilians caught in the crossfire and the delivery of supplies to those staying in the country.

“I think this is a significant progress,” Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator on the ceasefire talks, said in a video message.

More than 1 million people have already fled Ukraine in a rapid exodus after a week of war, as Russia’s military bombarded key cities across the country amid staunch resistance to the invasion.

The conflict has fueled a growing humanitarian crisis in Europe, and left those who have remained in Ukraine facing an intensifying assault from the air and the ground.

But a mileslong Russian military convoy threatening the Ukrainian capital has made little progress over the last three days. Russian forces’ northern advance has faced a fierce Ukrainian defense and its own logistical issues. They appear to have had made more significant gains in the south, with one key port city under Russian control and another struggling to hold out under siege.

The bombardment didn’t look like it would end anytime soon.

Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, an Élysée Presidential Palace source said, describing it as “not-so-friendly.”

Putin said the campaign would continue unless Ukraine accepted Moscow’s conditions, the source said.

The Russian leader told Macron in the call that the “situation will get worse, but Ukraine chose it,” the source said. “Putin’s goal is to take control of all of Ukraine,” they added.

Zelenskyy called on residents to keep up their resistance, while branding Russian soldiers “children who are being used.”

Moscow faced further international isolation and condemnation. But the country vowed to press on with the war even as officials from both sides sat down for a second round of talks in Belarus that concluded without any significant breakthroughs.

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator, said his team agreed with Ukrainian negotiators to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military has established channels to communicate directly with the Russian military as a way to deconflict tactical movements around Ukraine, according to a senior defense official.

'Humanitarian catastrophe'

From the capital, Kyiv, to Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south, Russia’s advances have brought destruction to major Ukrainian cities and civilian areas.

The bombardment of Ukrainian cities has pushed residents to flee to neighboring countries and forced many more of the nation's 44 million residents to seek shelter underground or head west by road or train.

“I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one,” Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said in a statement issued Thursday.

In Lviv, a city in the country's west that has become a hub for international diplomats and the news media, trains heading out of Ukraine are packed with families desperate to make it to safety.

Many are wheeling small suitcases and carrying backpacks containing all the possessions they could carry. In the frigid temperatures, parents are wrapped up in thick winter coats and hats, their children’s faces scared.

Serheii Shpak, 28, said it took two days for his family to make it from Kharkiv to Lviv. He decided it was time to leave after sheltering in the metro system with his 1-year-old son and wife while Russian forces shelled the city.

He said the journey was filled with panicked Ukrainians trying to make it to safety. “The carriages were really crowded,” said Shpak, a web developer.

He said he planned to head to nearby Vinnytsia so his family could start a new life further from the threat of Russian attacks.

The Unites States will extend what's known as temporary protected status, which would allow them to remain in the country without fear of deportation, for 18 months to Ukrainian nationals on U.S. soil as of March 1, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced Thursday. People who enter the U.S. after that date will not be eligible.

""Our hearts stand with the Ukrainian people who are suffering so much tragedy and so much loss,"" Mayorkas said in a video posted to Twitter. ""We will do everything in our power to support them.""

The Biden administration Thursday also asked Congress to provide $10 billion in humanitarian and defense assistance for Ukraine.
