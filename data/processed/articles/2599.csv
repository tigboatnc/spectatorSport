Bennett, during an interview on Kan public broadcaster, was asked whether he ""calls the massacre in Bucha a war crime"" or whether ""he sees Russia as responsible."" The prime minister replied: ""We are of course shocked by the terrible sights at Bucha – awful scenes – and we strongly condemn them. The suffering of Ukrainian citizens is immense, and we're doing everything we can to assist.""

Israel's Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, meanwhile, speaking in English during a visit to Athens, said: ""The images and testimony from Ukraine are horrific. Russian forces committed war crimes against a defenseless civilian population. I strongly condemn these war crimes.""

The discovery of the slain civilians, many of them bound, after the withdrawal of Russian forces from Bucha has stirred a global outcry. Kyiv deemed them evidence of genocide. Moscow has denied responsibility and accused Ukraine of trying to smear it.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that the killings were no random act of a rogue unit but part of a deliberate Russian campaign to commit atrocities.

Israel has been restrained in its criticism of Russia during the Ukraine crisis, citing Bennett's efforts to broker peace. Israel also wants to keep channels open to the Russian military in Syria, where it often mounts air strikes on Iranian assets.

Bennett has never condemned Russia, leaving the job to Foreign Minister Lapid instead. While Israel supported a United Nation General Assembly resolution condemning Moscow, it declined to back a similar motion placed before the Security Council.

Lapid had earlier on Sunday condemned the killings in the Kyiv suburb.

""It is impossible to remain indifferent in the face of the horrific images from the city of Bucha near Kyiv, from after the Russian army left,"" Lapid tweeted. ""Intentionally harming a civilian population is a war crime and I strongly condemn it.""

On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine will become a “‘big Israel' with its own face,” indicating that his country intends to emulate the Israeli security state in the wake of Russia’s invasion.",https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-lapid-accuses-russia-of-war-crimes-in-bucha-as-bennett-avoids-casting-blame-1.10721997

JERUSALEM, April 5 (Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid condemned on Tuesday Russia's ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, intensifying Israel's criticism of Russia since the fighting in Ukraine started.

""The images and testimony from Ukraine are horrific. Russian forces committed war crimes against a defenseless civilian population. I strongly condemn these war crimes,"" he said in a statement.

“A large and powerful country has invaded a smaller neighbor without any justification. Once again, the ground is soaked with the blood of innocent civilians,” Lapid charged while in Greece, speaking alongside his Cypriot and Greek counterparts, according to a statement from his spokesman.

“The images and testimony from Ukraine are horrific. Russian forces committed war crimes against a defenseless civilian population. I strongly condemn these war crimes,” Lapid said in reference to the alleged atrocities committed in the Kyiv suburb Bucha.

Lapid noted that the war in Ukraine offered opportunities for new energy partnerships, saying that it will “change the structure of the European and Middle Eastern energy market.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett condemned the killing of civilians in Bucha, but did not blame Russia or anyone else for the atrocities.

“We are shocked by the difficult pictures coming from Bucha, terrible scenes,” he said while visiting an army post in the West Bank.

Asked about the alleged mass killings of civilians by Russian forces, Bennett said, “We condemn them with all force.”

He noted that “the suffering of Ukrainian citizens is huge” and noted that Israel has set up a field hospital in western Ukraine, which “all Israelis should be proud of.”

Israel has avoided aligning too closely with either side since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February 24. It is one of the few countries that maintains relatively warm relations with both Ukraine, a fellow Western democracy, as well as Russia.

Moscow controls the airspace over Syria, in which Israel operates to target Iranian proxies, and this is seen as a key reason for Israel’s careful comments on the war.

While Lapid has taken a clearer stance against Russia, condemning its actions in Ukraine on several occasions and vowing that Israel will not be used as a “route to bypass” sanctions on Russian oligarchs, Bennett has avoided blaming Russia, instead attempting to position himself as a mediator in the conflict.

His attempt at neutrality may prove increasingly difficult to maintain as world anger at Russia’s alleged actions against civilians grows.

Earlier Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of a “deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape” in Bucha.

His comments were among the strongest yet from the West after pictures of mass graves and streets strewn with dead civilians emerged from suburbs around Kyiv after Russian forces retreated.

The atrocities there were “not the random acts of a rogue unit,” he argued, adding that the US and its allies were determined to make sure those responsible are brought to justice and to increase pressure on Russia while backing Ukraine.

Blinken made the comments in Maryland before boarding a plane to Brussels for a NATO meeting.

The United Nations said Tuesday that all the signs from Bucha pointed toward civilians having been directly targeted and killed in the town outside Kyiv.

The UN Human Rights Office said the images emerging from Bucha were extremely disturbing and underlined that international law prohibited deliberate attacks on civilians.

“What we’re talking about here appears to be the direct killing and targeting of civilians in Bucha,” rights office spokeswoman Liz Throssell told reporters in Geneva.

Moscow has rejected Western accusations that its forces were responsible, suggesting the images are fake or that the deaths occurred after they pulled out.

But newly released satellite photographs taken by Maxar Technologies in mid-March, before the Russian withdrawal, showed what appeared to be bodies in some of the same places they were later found by Ukrainian troops and seen by journalists.

Italy, Spain, and Denmark joined EU allies Tuesday in expelling Russian diplomats amid increasing outrage over the Ukraine conflict, with around 150 sent home in the last 48 hours. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that the mass expulsion of its diplomats was “a short-sighted move.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/lapid-explicitly-accuses-russia-of-war-crimes-in-first-for-top-israeli-official/

Pope Francis on Wednesday kissed a battered Ukrainian flag ""from that martyred city Bucha,"" fount of ""testimony of new atrocities"" and ""horrendous cruelty carried out against civilians, defenseless women and children,"" the ""victims whose innocent blood cries up to the sky and implores that this war be stopped.""

There is convincing evidence, despite Moscow's denials, that Russia is responsible for the war crimes in Bucha. Countries with closer ties with Russia than the Vatican have started condemning the horrors documented out of Bucha and other areas of Ukraine under recent Russian occupation. Most aren't explicitly pinning the blame on Moscow, though they're now tiptoeing up to that line.

""The images of the massacre ... are horrifying and sad for humanity,"" Turkey's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday. ""The targeting of innocent civilians is unacceptable. It is our basic expectation that the issue is subjected to an independent investigation, that those responsible are identified and are held accountable."" Turkey has been striving to be an honest broker between Kyiv and Moscow.

India, which continues to buy Russian oil and has abstained from United Nations votes condemning Russia for its Ukraine invasion, called the Bucha reports ""deeply disturbing"" on Tuesday. ""We unequivocally condemn these killings and support the call for an open investigation,"" India's U.N. ambassador T.S. Tirumurti said. China's U.N. ambassador and Foreign Ministry also called the Bucha reports ""deeply disturbing"" and called for an investigation.

Cracks are also showing in countries trying to keep neutral on Russia.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on Tuesday went much further than Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, saying ""Russian forces committed war crimes against a defenseless civilian population"" and reiterating ""Israel's condemnation of the Russian invasion and the war crimes we have been exposed to in recent days."" Bennett has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and is careful not to blame Russia.

And even as India's government made what the BBC calls ""the strongest statement it has made since Russia invaded Ukraine,"" the opposition Congress Party said India's position is becoming untenable. ""Russia has been a trusted friend of India, and it has been a long-standing ally,"" lawmaker Manish Tewari said in Parliament. But ""friends also have to be told if they are wrong, that they possibly need to get their act together.""",https://theweek.com/russo-ukrainian-war/1012222/russias-bucha-horrors-are-pushing-india-turkey-other-studiously-neutral
