As it turns out, it's not only eyes that have been zeroing in on this target.

Did Ukraine destroy Russian convoy?

Russian authorities maintain their stance that its actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists. Don't ask them to provide any real evidence for this, though. Propaganda doesn't work like that.

There is no doubt that Ukraine's military is dwarfed by that of its powerful neighbour - something we assessed earlier in the conflict - but resistance in the first week has slowed Russia's progress, particularly in urban areas. It's incredible how resilient a people can be when they have a real cause to fight for.

Russia has, of course, made significant gains, and has captured one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson - and has bombarded others with increasing intensity, including Kyiv and the country's second city Kharkiv.

But that giant column of Russian armour, which looked so threatening in the last couple of days, has stalled as it approaches Kyiv from the north, delayed by resistance, as well as mechanical failures and congestion, according to the British defence ministry. And that makes it a relatively sitting duck for the Ukranians.

One thing to note about the column is that there have been various conflicting reports about the length of it. I've seen 40 kilometres cited, as well as 64 km and 18 km, among others. The key thing to remember is that it is a moveable beast, and depending on elements such as fuel supplies or road space, the dimensions are naturally going to change. One thing that is not in doubt is that it is a mighty force, although some suggestions are that it is made up of a number of smaller groups, combined due to these problems in advancing at pace.

Which brings us to the attacks. As reported by the head of Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, Ukraine's armed forces have been firing at that long line of Russian troops.

“We are striking the enemy’s columns,” Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Military Times in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. “We burn many columns of the enemy.

“My intelligence officers and agents are directing and calling the strikes,” he said.

The strikes, he said, are being conducted by Ukraine Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets, artillery and missile barrages.

Ukraine's 'hedgehogs' face up to Russian tanks

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the violence and crossed into neighbouring countries. Men of fighting age are prevented from leaving Ukraine.

And as Russian troops closed in Kyiv on Thursday, a muddy construction site in a local neighbourhood was teeming with workers and welders of the KAN real estate developer. Instead of homes and offices, however, they were making giant, metal anti-tank barricades known as ""hedgehogs"", and smaller spiked barriers aimed at stopping wheeled vehicles. After Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, KAN, a large local property company, reinvented itself to help the defences of the city of 3.4 million people.

Zakhar, a foreman, picked up the phone and started calling the company's construction workers who had remained in Kyiv. Almost everyone volunteered to stay and contribute, he said.

""We build things. We do not know how to fight, but we knew we could be useful,"" Zakhar said. A few metres away sparks flew as builders cut through and welded together large metal beams. It is another example of how Ukrainian civilians are supporting regular troops as they try to repel Russia's advance, including through civil defence units and independent militia that have formed across the country.

Boxing champ Klitschko ready to block, parry and counter

On 25 February, Kyiv's mayor and boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, said the city ""has gone into the defensive phase.""

Heavy equipment was brought in to build concrete checkpoints, blocking positions and bunkers inside the city and along all major roads and in the suburbs.

At KAN, workers cut long pieces of girder using blow torches and angle grinders, welding them together into triangular barriers used to bolster fortifications and slow the movement of tanks and tracked armoured personnel carriers.

Oleksandr Bodyuk, the company's deputy director, said workers were also using reinforcing bars and girders salvaged from construction sites to produce spiked, movable defences against wheeled vehicles, including trucks.

So far the makeshift factory, which started operating this week, has produced 110 large hedgehogs, including 40 in the fist 12 hours, Bodyuk said, adding that the company runs other similar sites in the city.

""We have demands from many places for these types of blocking devices, we deliver them wherever they are needed in the area ... subcontractors and friends are providing transportation for the products and the material,"" he said.

Andriy Kryschenko, Kyiv's deputy mayor who was wearing military fatigues, said many similar firms and workshops had adapted to produce hedgehogs, concrete barriers and other defences.

He added that tens of thousands of people in Kyiv had received weapons and many more were waiting at enlistment and recruitment offices. The city hall was also supporting Territorial Defence units and troops at the frontline, Kryschenko said.

At the construction site, Serhiy Serdyuk, a grizzled welder in his 50s, said workers were ready to take up weapons and join the fight.

In the south, Russian forces have taken control of the city of Kherson. Further north, Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv and its capital of Kyiv have been under air and artillery strikes. The Russian advance, however, has been slowed by stiff resistance and apparent logistical woes.

Perhaps nothing has come to represent that more than the convoy of Russian vehicles strung out along various sections of a roadway north of Kyiv, at times stretching out to 40 miles in length.

Satellite images taken by U.S.-based Maxar Technologies were first released on Sunday, showing hundreds of vehicles, including supply trucks, tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery dotting the roadway.

On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that the Russian column had “not made any appreciable progress, geographically speaking, in the last 24 to 36 hours,” and described the Russian advance as “stalled.”

Experts and observers have focused on two probable reasons for the delay: logistics and a needed pause for Russian forces brought on by stiffer than expected Ukrainian resistance before they begin the next phase of their advance.

“It reflects the fact that this invasion was in fact poorly planned, poorly, poorly prepared, and is being poorly conducted,” Frederick W. Kagan, director of the Critical Threats project at the American Enterprise Institute, told the New York Times on Tuesday. “That column reflects, in part, Russia scrambled to adjust to problems that they had created by the way that they prepared and conducted this attack.”

“We do believe that they have experienced logistics and sustainment challenges – that we don’t believe they have fully anticipated,” said Kirby on Wednesday.

From Operation Market Garden to the so-called “Highway of Death” during the Gulf War, it doesn’t take a tactical genius to know that hundreds of vehicles strung out over dozens of miles of road does not represent sound military strategy. This is especially true as muddy conditions on the ground are making it harder for tanks to operate in the open.

Those vehicles, some spread far apart from one another, and some reportedly packed two and three abreast, remain vulnerable to attack from their flanks and from the air unless there is an aggressive defense effort to protect the entire corridor. Vehicles that have run out of fuel block the roadway and require recovery. And reassembling and reorganizing units in the aftermath presents its own set of time-consuming logistical challenges.

Despite the logistical challenges Russian forces have faced, and the success Ukraine has already had in striking Russian armor, attacking what seems like such a large target may be more complicated than it looks.

“We’ve seen that Ukraine has been very effective with their drones, especially the Bayraktars [Bayraktar TB2], but those are a limited resource,” said John Amble, editorial director of the Modern Warfare Institute at West Point. “You don’t want to risk them unless it’s a priority target, which right now is artillery that is shelling those cities.”

There is also a weather factor. With cloudy skies having blanketed the area over the convoy at the beginning of the week. In those conditions, the Bayraktar drones are limited in their effectiveness. In 2020, during fighting over the city of Shusha in the Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and the Armenian-backed Republic of Artsakh, separatist forces were able to mount their most successful counter-attacks during foggy weather, when Azerbaijan’s use of the Bayraktar drone was effectively negated.

Amble also noted that Russian forces are almost certain to be learning and adjusting their tactics, and may be integrating air defense assets with their convoys, making them an even riskier target to attack.

In other words, when outmanned and outgunned, and with limited resources, it may not be worth it for Ukraine to launch a large-scale attack on the convoy, however vulnerable it may be.

However, a report from Military Times on Wednesday suggested that Ukrainian aircraft had successfully struck the convoy. The strikes were reportedly carried out by Ukrainian warplanes, Su-24 and Su-25 fighters, and included artillery.

“We are striking the enemy’s columns,” said Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, according to Military Times. “We burn many columns of the enemy.”

During the 3 p.m. Pentagon press briefing on Wednesday, Kirby stated that there were only unconfirmed efforts by Ukrainian forces to hamper the convoy’s progress toward Kyiv.

“We have some indications that the Ukrainians have, in fact, tried to slow down that convoy,” Kirby said, adding that “we have no reason to doubt those reports; but again, we can’t speak to it in great specificity.”

5,21ee3c70-46f7-42d1-8e65-b181c8f99699,['The Economist'],2022-03-04 00:00:00,"V ALERY GERASIMOV , Russia’s enigmatic chief of general staff, once co-authored a short manual for his commanders, called “The principles of victory in combat”. Russian officers had become too predictable, he thought. Surprise is achieved by “striking the enemy at a time or place or in a manner for which the enemy is unprepared.” Yet it is hard to think of a less dynamic attack than the one approaching Kyiv from the north-west. A Russian military convoy, no less than 60km long, has been moving at snail’s pace towards the capital. It epitomises Russia’s plodding approach to the war so far.

The convoy stretches from Prybirsk, a town near Chernobyl, down to at least Antonov airport, the site of a Russian helicopter assault on the first day of the war. Its most recent location is hard to pin down, since the area has been cloudy in recent days. But on March 3rd British defence intelligence claimed, with some satisfaction, that the column had made “little discernible progress in over three days”. A day later an American defence official concurred, noting that it remained 25km from the centre of Kyiv. Perhaps the most important reason for this is logistics. Russian fuel, engineering and other supply units have struggled to keep up with frontline forces, leaving vehicles stranded on the road. Video footage shows Ukrainian tractors gleefully towing away what are purported to be abandoned Russian air-defence systems and armoured vehicles. In an article published on the War on the Rocks website in November, Alex Vershinin, an American army officer, noted that Russian units are far heavier on artillery and air-defences than their NATO counterparts. This makes logistics tougher: a unit that fires 4,000 shells a day needs 50 trucks a day to replenish. Russia’s army would not have enough trucks to “meet its logistic requirement” more than 90 miles beyond supply dumps, he concluded. Supplying a large invasion force in a huge country would stress any army. But Russia has further woes. “The Russians seemed to have fixed themselves to roads,” observes Mick Ryan, a retired major-general who led Australia’s defence college until recently. That, he says, has slowed them down. Mr Ryan points to the cautionary example of Operation Market Garden in 1944, the Allied effort to shorten the war by seizing crossings over the Rhine in the second world war. Britain’s XXX Corps made an arduous advance over a single narrow road, plagued by boggy ground on either side and German counter-attacks.

Russia’s repetition of that mistake may be a function of deeper military dysfunction. Trent Telenko, a former auditor for America’s Defence Contract Management Agency, has pointed to video footage of a Russian Pantsir- S1 air-defence system that was stuck in the mud and captured by Ukraine. Tires, he notes, need to be periodically moved to exercise the inflation system and to avoid exposing any one part to continuous sunlight.

That Russian forces have not done this basic maintenance may reflect endemic corruption. In 2019 Russian military prosecutors said that losses from corruption had spiralled and exceeded 7bn roubles (around $109m at the time). Neglected tires will fail to get through mud and must stick to paved paths. Images of the convoy show trucks crowded on the road, three abreast, preventing anything from passing. In some cases, Russian soldiers have even punched holes in their fuel tanks to avoid facing combat. Western officials say that the biggest problem is not that Ukraine has blown up key bridges, but that Russian bridging units have been unable to get through the congestion to build new ones.

Such a long and exposed convoy should be a juicy target for air strikes. Ukraine still has aircraft in the sky and its Turkish-made TB2 drones have struck Russian forces in other parts of the country. Yet Russia is likely to have deployed air-defence and electronic-warfare systems around the column, making it harder for Ukrainian aircraft to approach. Troops are another matter. The level of Ukrainian resistance has shocked Russian commanders. Just as German soldiers harassed the British column in Operation Market Garden, Ukrainians appear to be picking off elements of the Russian force.

There has been fierce fighting in Bucha and Gostomel, where the front of the convoy was estimated to be on March 1st, with images showing large quantities of destroyed Russian armour. On March 2nd Ukrainian forces claimed to have liberated the village of Makariv, to the south-west of the convoy. A day later they reportedly counter-attacked at Ivankiv, close to its northern end. American officials say that Ukrainian forces have used Javelin anti-tank missiles to destroy Russian tanks and block the road. At least three Russian commanders have been killed in different parts of the country after they ventured to the front, frustrated by their lack of progress.

Yet the fog of war remains thick. Russia may have chosen to slow down its movement in order to synchronise its various advances on Kyiv. Russian forces to the west of the Dnieper river have moved faster and farther than those to the east of it, which have been held up in fierce fighting. If the aim is to encircle Kyiv, in preparation for a siege, Russia might be waiting for its eastern thrust to catch up, suggests Mathieu Boulegue of Chatham House, a think-tank.

Progress in southern Ukraine has been quicker still, with Russian forces taking their first major city, Kherson, on March 2nd or 3rd and seizing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, on March 4th. Zaporizhzhia is only 85km to the city of Dnipro, a key junction and crossing point on the Dnieper. Prior to the war, Ukraine’s best and most numerous forces were in the east of the country, facing the Donbas region, the site of a Russian-backed proxy war. Those forces are at risk of being cut off from the rest of the country.

Nor is congestion unknown in big wars. The German advance into France in May 1940 was described as “the largest traffic jam in European history”, by Rolf-Dieter Müller, a German historian. It resulted in a 250km-long logjam through the Ardennes that ended 80km east of the Rhine. The Germans, of course, got there in the end. ■

The armoured column threatening Kyiv is bogged down around 30km (19 miles) from the centre of the city, having been slowed by Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion, with vehicles becoming stuck in mud and shortages of food, water and fuel.

""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,"" the MoD said in an intelligence update.

An unnamed US defence official briefing on the situation near Kyiv concurred, saying the 40-mile-long Russian column containing hundreds of tanks and other vehicles still appeared to be roughly 25km from the city and had barely gained any ground in days.

Satellite imagery provided by Maxar showed Russia was sending further columns of troops and vehicles to strengthen its advances on key cities including Kyiv.

In Borodyanka, a small town 60 km, northwest of Kyiv, locals had repelled a Russian assault, and Reuters reported that burnt out hulks of destroyed Russian armour were scattered on a road.

""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again.

""An old man ran outside like crazy, with big round eyes, and said 'give me a Molotov cocktail! I just set their APC on fire!...Give me some petrol, we'll make a Molotov cocktail and burn the tank!'.""

Overnight, Ukrainian forces were said to have cut off the convoy from the west and had been able to attack it from the air.

War strategists have warned that Vladimir Putin’s goal is to encircle Kyiv in the hope that the Ukrainian military is forced to surrender.
