Ukraine still has a “significant majority” of its military aircraft available nine days after Russian forces started their invasion of the country, a United States defence official told the Reuters news service on Friday.

Vastly outmatched by Russia’s military in terms of numbers and firepower, the fact that Ukraine’s own air force is still flying and its air defenses are still deemed to be viable has surprised military experts.

“The Ukrainians still have a significant majority of their air combat power available to them, both fixed-wing and rotary wing as well as unmanned systems and surface-to-air systems,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Ukrainian aircraft had suffered some losses, including being destroyed by Russian forces, but did not give details. After the opening salvos of the war on February 24, analysts expected the Russian military to try to immediately destroy Ukraine’s air force and air defenses.

Russia has fired more than 500 missiles at Ukrainian targets since the start of the invasion, but is still flying through contested airspace.

Ukrainian troops with surface-to-air rockets are able to threaten Russian aircraft and create risk to Russian pilots trying to support ground forces. Ukraine’s ability to keep flying air force jets is a visible demonstration of the country’s resilience in the face of attack and has been a morale booster, both to its own military and Ukraine’s people, experts say.

No ‘no-fly’ zone

The Pentagon has established a new hotline with Russia’s ministry of defence to prevent “miscalculation, military incidents and escalation” in the region as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine advances.

The “deconfliction” hotline would be an open phone line based at the US European Command’s headquarters and would fall under Air Force General Tod Wolters, who leads all US forces on the continent.

“In our initial test of it, (the Russians) answered the phone,” the official said.

NATO is refusing to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The leaders of the 30-nation military organization believe that such a move could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear power Russia.

“We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.

The United States on Friday defended NATO’s decision echoing its position that such a measure could cause the conflict to spread to more countries.

“We have a responsibility to ensure the war does not spill over beyond Ukraine … A no-fly zone could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Brussels.

In a video address earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had urged Western nations to consider such a measure to stop any further bombardment by Russia.

Russian advances

Russian troops on Friday were still about 25km (16 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, a distance largely unchanged over the past few days. Frequent shelling could be heard from the center of the city as battles involving air attacks and artillery raged northwest of Kyiv.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of the strategic port of Mariupol, knocking out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, and most phone service. Food deliveries were also cut, according to the Associated Press.

Ukrainians were fleeing the port city of Odesa as Ukrainian officials warned Russia was preparing to conduct an amphibious assault like the one around Mariupol, involving naval infantry and ground forces attacking from the north out of Donetsk.

“So one could see a scenario where that’s a similar play,” the US official told Reuters.

After heavy shelling, Russian forces have captured the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000 — the first major city to fall.

Tanks entered Kherson, a provincial capital, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.

“The Department of the Defense recently established a deconfliction line with the Russian Ministry of Defense on March 1 for the purposes of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation,” a senior US defense official said in a statement. “The United States retains a number of channels to discuss critical security issues with the Russians during a contingency or emergency.”

The communications line is basically an exchange of phone numbers between both sides for quick access. The US side will be run out of the US European Command’s operations center in Stuttgart, Germany, while the Russian side is expected to be coordinated out of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, a second senior defense official said.

The US had wanted a communications channel because US and Russian troops are now operating on the so-called eastern flank close to Ukraine and Belarus airspace where Russian forces are staging and attacking.

The second official did not know what events would specifically trigger a phone call on either side, but the overall idea is to ensure “we can reduce the risk of miscalculation and potential misunderstanding” given the potential proximity of forces. It was also not immediately clear to what extent NATO aircraft would be included in the agreement. It is also unclear if US and Russian ships are included.

Air operations are particularly concerned because of the high speed and relatively short distances at which encounters could occur given Russian aircraft are operating close to the areas where US troops are in Poland, Romania and the Baltic nations.

The establishment of the agreement is particularly noteworthy because until now Pentagon officials have said they have not had any direct communications with Russian counterparts since the invasion.

There had been an effort to establish the communications line since late last month. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last spoke with Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu on Feb.18. The two also spoke one week earlier. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley last spoke to the Chief of Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov on Feb. 11.

The US has specifically rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine saying it would put US pilots into a combat scenario in order to enforce such a plan. But the door is not shut on a potential future air humanitarian corridor to guarantee safe flight of relief supplies hostilities cease, officials say.

More back ground: A deconfliction protocol has existed for several years between US and Russian forces in Syria. For the most part it has worked, although US officials have complained on several occasions the Russians have not given enough advance warning of their operations. The US does not give Russia detailed information but did notify them recently when US aircraft would be operating in a broad area northeast Syria.

NBC News first reported the establishment of the deconfliction channel.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-03-22/h_91f5614af4ffc6e9b868cdc3423c1d34

Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

Russians attacked a vast line of Ukrainian tanks, transport vehicles, and personnel carriers from two directions. When a tank we passed was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, we ditched our car. We ran from one place to another only to be turned back by rockets and artillery. We jumped into the bed of an old Soviet transport truck and cowered among stacks of tires. Bullets whizzed by above.

We were still in Mariupol when Russia invaded Ukraine—though it has been invading since 2014. We headed west as fast as we could, but that drove us straight into Kherson, in that truck right in the middle of the worst battle Ukraine had seen in a long time.

It was one of the first major clashes since Russia had invaded Ukraine early that morning. At this stage, Russia was making massive land grabs. Troops from Crimea had come north to seize a nearby airport.

“ The corpses of dead Russian soldiers were left out on display. ”

The attack began at an overpass on the P-47 highway at 3 p.m. on Feb. 24, just outside Kherson, a strategic juncture near a small airport 100 km from the northern border of Crimea. As the explosions grew closer, we took out our phones and recorded videos saying goodbye to our 2-year-old sons and our families.

When we watch those videos now, we are overcome with shame and loathing for putting ourselves in that position.

In front of us was a dilapidated concrete structure. We ran for it, crawled beneath, and hid in the dirt. A truck driver and a farmer followed us. There were no windows or blankets, but the farmer found a moldy bed lining for us. And though magnificent flames reached into the sky around us in every direction, there would be no fire for us.

It was the longest and coldest night of our lives, and we didn’t sleep a wink. In the days since, when we can sleep, we dream of the dismembered, mutilated bodies we passed on our way out of that place. We spent the night freezing in the room above, uploading and deleting videos, photos, and interviews from our 14-hour embed the day before.

That day was spent with the volunteer Ukrainian paramilitary team Third Force, on the front near Mariupol. We had bonded with these men, an almost mythic team of 15 fighters, whose commander goes by the codename Groz. He knows that even guerrilla warfare is a war of hearts and minds. It is the first thing that he told us, and the last.

Ukraine has been at war for about eight days, but these guys had been at war for eight years. They have been fighting the Russian-backed separatists and FSB agents who attack them from the other side of the line just east of Mariupol, in the breakaway territory called the Donetsk People's Republic, which Russia recognized as independent of Ukraine the day before we embedded with them. In our time together, they showed us everything: their methods and tactics, their improvisation, their tech campaigns, and their tremendous cache of ammo. They fed us and told us about themselves.

Earlier that day, they led us down a road lined with minefields on either side. The mines were left by Russian-backed separatists who took control of this area but knew they would not have it for long. There are ominous warning signs posted along the field. As we were walking, Groz yelled at me to stay on the road—with genuine panic in his eyes.

Eventually, we reached a strikingly beautiful beach on the sea of Azov where we were given a demonstration of their drones. One of the younger soldiers slips on the VR headset. Groz scans the area with his assault rifle. The drone takes off at 90 mph, straight to the front line. Soon afterwards, we heard bursts of gunfire, and the fighter with the VR headset began laughing. The drone came back unharmed, and we walked back to the base more carefully than we’ve ever walked in our lives.

That night, we met the head of an NGO called Blue Yellow, which delivers supplies to various battalions on the front. His codename is Panda. The work of Blue Yellow has become the stuff of legend, and for those seeking to help the front lines Blue Yellow would be a good place to start. Groz and Panda tell me that nearly all of the funding from the United States government never makes it to its destination. They believe that this is a matter of inefficiency rather than corruption.

When Groz dropped us off at the hotel that night, he hugged us. He removed the signature arm patch of the battalion from his shoulder and handed it over to us. Then he was gone.

Several hours later, the real war began. We realized the danger we were in and also the danger that Third Strike could face if we were detained. We knew we wouldn’t be treated like journalists. For the Russian forces currently targeting civilian dwellings, the Geneva Conventions are just a punchline. The easy thing to do would be to delete everything. But Groz went to great risk in giving away his position and tactics,and for a reason: He was counting on us to tell his story. Groz wants the world to know that this fight will not be the fight Russia is expecting. These men are ready for all types of warfare. They are innovative. And there are many more like them.

In seeking to put as much distance between ourselves and Mariupol, we drove straight into the hell in Kherson that has followed us both home and will likely drag us back.

In that concrete structure in Kherson, we watched as Russian tanks rolled by just outside the window and forces from both sides roamed around the surrounding forests. The battle shifted to a nearby bridge, which Ukrainian forces were trying to take back. We were in Russian-controlled territory, and this bridge was our only way out. All night, Russian jets bombed Ukrainian forces as they struggled to maintain control. Somehow, the Ukrainians prevailed.

Just before dawn, we received a message from an intelligence contact who had been checking in on us all night looking for a way to get us out. He said that Ukrainians had taken back the bridge but he had no idea if it was safe to get there. We knew this might be our only chance. So, we made a mad dash for that bridge.

As we drove back onto the highway towards the overpass where we had been when the fighting broke out, we were witness to a charred wasteland. Bombed-out Ukrainian tanks were everywhere. The corpses of dead Russian soldiers were left out on display. As we got closer to the bridge, the scenery grew worse. We passed pieces of dead Russian soldiers. Near the top of the bridge, in the middle of the road was the nude upper torso of a bifurcated human being.

We were told that 30 minutes after we crossed that bridge, Russian forces took it back. We headed west for Odessa. But we knew we couldn’t stay there long. There were reports of Russian groups roaming the city at night, creating havoc. We hired a driver to take us to the Moldovan border. But refugee crises had already begun. Traffic was backed up for miles.

So instead, we headed for the unrecognized state of Transnistria, a narrow strip of Russian-backed breakaway Moldovan territory along the Ukrainian border. Upon entry, we were detained by the Transnistria KGB and politely interrogated. They didn’t know what to make of us. The suspicion quickly turned to fascination and bafflement. Eventually, they let us go, and we crossed into Moldova. Our relief to be on EU territory was immeasurable. But Moldovan airspace was closed, and it would be days before we would get back home.

Many more have died since that night on Feb. 24, and many more are likely to die in the days and weeks to come. It’s been a long time since one man held the Free World hostage with his delusional inferiority complex. But as Putin deprives 44 million people of their humanity and their allies of our honor and integrity, the least we could do, as journalists, was put his depravity on full display.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-russia-ukraine-battle-in-kherson-that-had-us-filming-our-dying-words

KYIV: Explosions in Kyiv began around 5 in the morning of Feb. 23. Sites initially targeted by Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, produced by the Ekaterinburg, Russia-based Novator defence enterprise, included facilities close to the civilian Kyiv/Borispol international airport. The airport was then closed after a bombardment the same morning and has never reopened.

Shortly after Russia launched its invasion, a woman stood in central Moscow with the well-known Red Square and Lenin Masoleum in the background and held up a small sign reading the war on Ukraine was Pozor Rossii, “Russia’s Infamy.” Her description has turned out to be more than prescient.

There have now been days of intense fighting in and around major Ukrainian cities. Stories of individual bravery on the part of the Ukrainian forces — some of them heart-breaking — are circulating everywhere thanks to a network of social media sites, Ukraine news channels and other outlets. Pre-war speculation was that the entirety of Ukraine’s mobile and internet infrastructure would be destroyed by Russian cyberattacks, but no such shutdown of communications has yet occurred.

The overall assessment at this point by US and other NATO-nation observers is that despite almost a year’s worth of preparation by the Russian armed forces that had been massing at several points along the Ukraine border, the invasion is a “disaster and a borderline failure,” as one former US military officer, now working as a civilian contractor in Poland, told Breaking Defense.

Now, on the seventh day of the Russian-Ukrainian war, as additional columns of Moscow’s military vehicles — with what are described as “more battle-ready units” — are rolling towards the Ukrainian capital, two questions seem to be emerging.

First, how it is that the vaunted and feared Russian military, the focus of so many NATO wargames and planning sessions, has been unable to overwhelm the significantly smaller Ukrainian defenders? And second, faced with opposition that didn’t quickly roll over, what scenario is now likely to come from the forces of Russian President Vladimir Putin?

Amateurs Focus on Tactics, Professional Soldiers Study Logistics

For months these formations were allegedly building up a robust logistics chain, including blood packs and other medical supplies. Despite these preparations, on the third day of the war Russian units were already running out of rations.

One “Five Eyes” nation former intelligence officer on temporary duty in Kyiv informed Breaking Defense “Russian troops have been foraging, looting, and trading with civilians for food. If they are already running short of rations [on day three] then their logistics must be struggling immensely – and must have been so even all of these months in these staging areas.”

TV news channels have since broadcast video from security surveillance CCTV cameras inside of supermarkets showing Russian soldiers looting the stores of endless amounts of foodstuffs and then ransacking the tills in the check-out lanes and dumping bundles of the national currency, the Hrynva, into sacks Bonnie and Clyde-style.

Ukrainian Armed Forces (ZSU) sources state that multiple Russian units were already out of petrol by the third day of the war and were running low on ammunition as well. In Kharkiv, groups of as many as ten demoralized Russian soldiers are reported to have surrendered to the first, lone representative of the Ukrainian forces they encounter.

Russia has also suffered at least one high-level loss: Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division, who was reportedly killed earlier this week by Ukrainian forces.

More than one commentator from more than one nation has repeated the quote attributed to every famous military leader from Napoleon to Omar Bradley: “Amateurs focus on tactics, professional soldiers study logistics,” – and has then added the Russians seem to have forgotten that essential bit of military wisdom.

Russian military sources, speaking on background, also now admit the invasion was deeply flawed from the start. “There was no tactical plan,” said one. “Our plan, to the extent that there was one, was to ‘play it by ear’ and to just cope with any resistance as it appeared. This was because the expectation had been that we would take all these cities in one to four days and that Ukraine’s military would be immediately overwhelmed.”

Those who have watched the evolution — or rather the deterioration — of Russia’s military and the defense-industrial base that supports it are pointing out that the poor performance of Moscow’s forces has been a process unfolding for years now.

Today “Russia has no more Kalibr missiles left in strategic reserve,” said a Ukrainian defense enterprise director familiar with the program, “but that is not the end of their troubles. The guidance system, the seeker head and other critical modules [in the missile’s front end] contain about 60% imported electronic components. None of these will be available after the long list of sanctions being imposed on Russia now, so it is hard to see where any new missiles would ever come from.”

Ukrainian defense firms have deep insight into Russia’s defense industry, given how closely the two countries were tied up until 2014. Many of those social ties have remained in place even as relations between the two countries deteriorated.

The Kalibr is not the only program in trouble. One Ukrainian intelligence officer tells Breaking Defense that there are “numerous shortages of [Russian] weapon systems. The famous KBM plant in Tula and other factories controlled by longtime Putin allies the Rothenberg brothers are unable to physically fulfil orders for infantry weapons and ammunition.

“Weapons that are officially on the books and should be available for delivery to active-duty units are missing and the next production runs will be complete only in three to four months,” the officer said. Even that estimate assumes that the raw material inputs have not been pilfered as well and are still available — if not, the time frame could be considerably longer.

Russia’s forces have also not properly factored in the use by the Ukrainians of unmanned combat aircraft, specifically the TB2 Bayaktar armed strike drones which Kyiv have acquired from Turkey. Several Russian columns have been hit by these UCAVs, including one near Kharkiv, and there are news reports that Turkey has already shipped more TB2 systems to Ukraine since the invasion began.

What Happened to the Russian Military Playbook?

There was a early consensus among Washington talking heads, even before the conflict began, that the Ukrainians would never be able to prevail due to Moscow’s sheer superiority in numbers. That assessment assumed that the tens of thousands of pages published in past years in Russian military journals actually represented how the battle plan in Ukraine would play out.

But in the field this past week the Russian Army has behaved as though these plans never existed in the first place. Quoting again from the former Five Eyes intelligence officer:

“Russian tactical doctrine has been absent. They are taking exceptionally risky gambles that defy military logic, particularly since they lack air superiority. Tank units have been sent into urban areas with no infantry screen. Joint fires coordination is poor everywhere except on the Crimea-Kherson front. This ignores long-running historic doctrinal principles that rely on massed joint fires.”

“Russia’s Aerospace Force (VKS) seems to be failing in its mission to achieve air superiority. Not only is the Ukrainian Air Force (PSU) operating both manned and unmanned platforms successfully,” but almost 30 Russian fixed-wing aircraft and a like number of helicopters have been downed, per Ukrainian statistics. An unnamed Ukrainian Mikoyan MiG-29 pilot nicknamed “the Ghost of Kyiv” has supposedly downed more than 16 Russian aircraft; fact checkers are less confident in the pilot’s existence , but the story has proved a powerful rallying point.

“Despite its importance in modern Russian battle plans and extensive employment in the Donbas, Moscow’s legendary prowess with electronic warfare seems non-existent. Many of the most advanced systems that been at the top of the EW threat list appear to have never been engaged .”

Losses by Moscow’s military appear to be disastrously lopsided, given the overwhelming force arranged on Ukraine’s border over a two month period. Getting accurate data on the situation is nearly impossible, but as of Thursday morning, official Ukrainian statistics claim almost 9,000 Russian troops have been lost. For comparison, Soviet combat losses after almost a decade in Afghanistan totaled 15,000. The Ukrainian MoD also claims that Russia has lost more than 200 tanks, in excess of 900 armored vehicles, plus dozens of air defense units, artillery systems, motorized vehicles and other hardware.

Given the source, those figures are likely overstating the strength of the victories. For comparison, the independent Oryxspioenkop website, which has been tracking action through open-source intelligence, claims Russia has lost over 530 vehicles, including 220 destroyed, 130 abandoned by Russian forces, and 178 captured by Ukraine. True counts, however, are effectively impossible to come by.

Ukraine sources believe that Putin gave little thought to a “what if” contingency should the war turn into a protracted, costly conflict. If combat operations last more than ten days, the Ukrainians believe, the Russian side may have no choice other than to negotiate – as there will not be adequate resources left to commit to the field. According to one estimate, the war is costing Putin up to US $20 billion per day, which is an unsustainable trajectory.

At press time, it appeared the Belarus military might be sent across the border into Ukraine on Russia’s side to try and overwhelm the Ukrainians. However, one of the most high-profile opponents of Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko, Vadim Prokopiev, who is now in Kyiv heading up resistance efforts, told Breaking Defense that “committing the Belarusian military might be far less effective than Putin hopes. Demoralization among these troops is widespread – even more so than some of the Russian units that have already surrendered here in large numbers.”

Putin’s Dilemma

Prior to the invasion, there appear to have been few internal voices warning Putin that the operation could go south very rapidly, but that doesn’t mean no one predicted it.

Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, a well-respected former Russian officer, warned that an invasion of Ukraine would lead to multiple catastrophic consequences for Russia, almost all of which have now come to pass. In a strongly worded letter shared with the All-Russian Officers’ Assembly, he went so far as to demand Putin resign for even considering starting such a conflict.

As Ivashov warned, a wave of sanctions, embargos and western firms such as Boeing refusing to continue supplying parts and services is causing crippling damage to Russia’s economy. As of Thursday, the Russian ruble is trading at over 109 to the US dollar, while countries around the world are moving to claim Russian assets — including a number of superyachts owned by Putin’s closest circle. Russia now stands a very good chance of becoming a nation as isolated and cut off from the international financial system as Iran or the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

At home, there have been signs of an anti-war movement popping up, despite police quickly moving to arrest anyone who speaks up. The assumption of a quick victory and low casualties meant that the Kremlin’s propaganda machine had organized almost no counter-narratives to the anti-war movement and has been scrambling; there is now a growing belief Putin will declare martial law in the coming days.

Due to Putin’s increasing need to create phantom enemies abroad (invoking the red herring specter of Ukraine someday joining NATO), domestic “traitors” such as Aleksei Navalniy and an overall narrative of victimhood that has been visited mercilessly on Russia in general and him personally, victory in this war with Ukraine has become almost synonymous with the chances for his regime’s continued survival.

And yet, no preparations seem to have been made if the Russian Army failed in its mission.

A leading Ukrainian military commentator, Yuri Butusov, detailed one of the more high-profile successes by the ZSU and calling the botched invasion “a defeat that Putin cannot hide.” This particular incident has shades of the ingenuity Israel’s military was famous for in the initial years of its existence – utilizing outmoded technology to achieve tactical surprise.

“In response to bombing and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, the Ukraine 19th Missile Brigade fired previous-generation Tochka-U ballistic missiles at Russia’s Millerovo airbase and destroyed at least two of the newest-model VKS Sukhoi Su-30SM fighter aircraft,” he wrote on the second day of hostilities. “Ukraine managed to inflict this loss [on the Russians] using missiles more than 30 years old. The whole world can say what they want about our weakness, but we will use everything we have and everything we can to fight for our freedom.”

What makes observers increasingly nervous at this point, said the former Five Eyes nation intelligence officer, is “we’re now entering a very dangerous phase in which Russia may use its more indiscriminate weapons at scale to break urban resistance, especially in Kharkiv, but maybe even in Kyiv.” Some of this has already been seen in the Russian use of cluster munitions, which are banned by international convention, in bombings of Kharkiv, as well as the fear that Russia will use thermobaric weapons.

In Kyiv, the military leadership echoes these concerns and officially assess Moscow has come to the conclusion it cannot overcome the ZSU in the field, so Putin has now turned to terrorizing the Ukrainian population at large. Recent attacks on the city have included hits on the main TV tower that is near the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial, the main rail station and even centuries-old UNESCO-designated sites like St. Sophia’s cathedral.

More worrying are the growing speculations about the president-for-life’s mental and emotional state, something that has become a more mainstream concern over the last week.
