In a letter released on Tuesday (March 8th), CEO Kevin Johnson said that the coffee chain “condemns the horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia” and has therefore decided to “suspend all business activity in Russia”.

This includes “pausing store operations” and ceasing “shipment of all Starbucks products” in the country.

Number of Starbucks stores in Russia

In a letter to Starbucks partners on March 4th 2022, CEO Kevin Johnson revealed that there are currently 130 Starbucks branches in Russia.

However, these are not known as ‘cafés’, they are stores that sell Starbucks products and take away items and have little sitting.

All of these outlets are owned and operated by a licensed partner and there are 2,000 green apron partners across Russia.

Every one of these branches will be temporarily closed whilst Russia continues to attack Ukraine.

Starbucks offers support to partners

Kevin Johnson revealed that Starbucks will help those who will be affected by the closures.

“We will provide support to the nearly 2,000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood,” he said.

“Through this dynamic situation, we will continue to make decisions that are true to our mission and values and communicate with transparency.”

In an earlier letter, he also said: “I want to express deep care for the livelihoods of our 2,000 green apron partners in Russia.”

“Like you, my heart is heavy – and I want you to know that no matter what, we stand together, as partners,” he continued.

However, at the time of writing this it’s unclear how Starbucks will support the partners who have been forced to close their branches.

Coffee chain provides aid to Ukraine

Prior to the closure of all Starbucks stories in Russia, the coffee chain announced that it would provide financial aid to Ukraine in three ways.

Starbucks pledged to donate any royalties they receive from business operations in Russia to “humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine”.

They also announced that The Starbucks Foundation has contributed “$500,000 to World Central Kitchen and the Red Cross for humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine”.

Their EMEA business will also “continue to work in the market to support people in need through additional financial contributions and service”.

Mike Jason retired from the U.S. Army as a Colonel and went on to become a professor, historian, author, and speech writer. In recent years, he’s been notable both for his cogent explanation of U.S. failings during the occupation of Afghanistan, and his vocal defense of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman during Donald Trump’s first impeachment. Since this has been a day for looking at analysis of the situation in Ukraine and in Russia, this seems like a good time to bring up Jason’s look the other end of the cost of the war—what it will cost in the United States?

To start with, that costs is definitely worth it.

“The world, with American leadership, Is trying to choke off an aggressive fascist state without starting WWIII. As a result, gas prices are going to go up. Hell, the price of everything is going to go up.”

On the surface, this tradeoff seems almost superficial. Bring down an aggressive fascist state without directly engaging the U.S. military, and while doing everything possible to prevent the war from expanding outside it’s current area of conflict? It seems like an easy deal. However, as Jason points out, just because it’s a better deal than an actual shooting war between NATO and Russia, doesn’t mean it’s a get-out-of-pain free card. For many people, the increases in costs will hit hard. There are millions of people out there who are always on the brink when it comes to their finances. There are also people out there who might have just made a decision—like buying a new truck—which seemed completely reasonable without factoring in a war they didn’t know was coming.

“First, from my old unit pep talks: ‘don't be an asshole.’ Now is not the time to make your dig about someone's pick up truck choice or to be smug about your Tesla. Everything will cost more for everyone. Remember we are all in this together.”

For better than a decade, oil prices have been remarkably low. After peaking around 2008, at a point when it looked like $100 a barrel and up was the indefinite future, the rapid spread of fracking across the U.S. and around the world brought on a super abundance; a world where oil production has been limited by demand rather than production. In Cheap Oil World, some of the dependencies and decisions that were made seemed entirely reasonable (so long, of course, as the environment, and specifically the critical damage to the climate, weren’t considered).

But now we’re seeing the price of cheap oil and cheap natural gas. And if we’re not careful, we’ll pay for it in widening divisions in the U.S.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/3/8/2084691/-Ukraine-update-Trying-to-choke-off-an-aggressive-fascist-state-without-starting-WW-III

Rünnakud linnadele jätkuvad, ehkki Venemaa pakkus välja evakueerimiskoridoride loomise Kiievist, Mariupolist, Sumõst ja Harkivist. Ukraina sõnul viivad venelaste pakutud koridorid ainult Venemaale või Valgevenesse.

Ukrainast põgenenud inimeste arv ületas kahe miljoni piiri, teatas ÜRO pagulaste ülemvolinik Filippo Grandi.

Sadamalinnas Mariupolis on kümned tuhanded inimesed lõksus elektrita ning neil napib toitu ja vett. Nende evakueerimine ebaõnnestus, sest Venemaa ei pidanud relvarahust kinni.

Kiievist loodes asuvast Irpinist on põgenema pääsenud 2000 inimest. Seda hoolimata pidevast raketitulest.

Venemaa ja Ukraina pidasid kolmanda vooru läbirääkimisi, kuid milleski olulises kokkuleppele ei jõutud. Teisipäeval toimub Valgevenes neljas läbirääkimiste voor.

Kütusehinnad on viimase 13 aasta kõrgeimad. Lääneriikides püütakse leida võimalusi, kuidas vähem sõltuda Venemaa kütusest.

Harkivi lähistel hukkus Vene kindral Vitali Gerassimov.

Euroopa Komisjon esitas kava Venemaa fossiilkütuste kaotamise kohta. eesmärk on kaotada Euroopa sõltuvus Venemaa fossiilkütustest juba enne 2030. aastat. REPowerEU kava abil püütakse mitmekesistada gaasitarneid, kiirendada taastuvallikatest toodetud gaaside kasutuselevõttu ning asendada gaas kütte- ja elektritootmises. See võib vähendada ELi nõudlust Venemaa gaasi järele kahe kolmandiku võrra juba enne aasta lõppu.

Biden teatas, et USA keelab igasuguse Venemaa nafta ja maagaasi impordi! „See on samm, mida me astume, et tekitada Putinile täiendavat valu,“ ütles Biden. „Me liigume (sanktsioonidega) edasi, mõistes, et paljudel meie Euroopa liitlastel ei pruugi olla võimalik meiega ühineda. USA toodab siseriiklikult palju rohkem naftat kui kõik Euroopa riigid kokku.“

McDonalds sulgeb Venemaal oma restoranid. Toidu- ja tarbekaupade hiiglane Unilever, mis omab tuntud kaubamärke, nagu näiteks Lipton, Ben & Jerry's, Hellmans ja Dove, peatab oma toodete impordi ja ekspordi Venemaal ja lõpetab seal kõik investeeringud. Starbucks teatas, et lõpetab Venemaal tegevuse. Teisipäeav õhtu lõpuks teatas ka CocaCola Venemaal tegevuse peatamisest.

Zelenskõi ütles Briti parlamendisaadikutele, et Ukraina võitleb lõpuni. Korrates Churchilli kuulsat 1940. aasta kõnet ütles ta: „Me jätkame võitlust oma maa eest, mis iganes see maksab. Me võitleme metsades, põldudel, kallastel ja tänavatel. Ukraina ei anna alla ja me ei kaota!“ Kõnele järgnes brittide parlamendis maruline aplaus.

Suurbritannia lõpetab Venemaa nafta ja naftatoodete importimise 2022. aasta lõpuks.

Venemaa president Vladimir Putin allkirjastas korralduse, mis piirab rangelt kogu riigi tooraine ja toodete ekspordi Venemaa Föderatsioonist ning piirab ka importi. See korraldus kehtib vähemalt 31. detsembrini.
