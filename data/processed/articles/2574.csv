After taking Kherson, it seems that Russian forces are planning to occupy the port city of Odessa near the Black Sea.

The violence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hasn’t yet reached Odesa, the country’s third-largest city, but Vladimir Putin’s navy was headed there Wednesday night.

Several Russian warships from Crimea were headed to Odesa. An amphibious assault could come as soon as Thursday, U.S. officials told Fox News.

It comes as Russian forces attack the waterfront cities of Kherson and Mariupol.

In Odesa, a city of roughly one million people on Ukraine’s southern coast, supermarkets ran out of supplies days ago, according to Kate, a 24-year-old local manager who asked to withhold her last name due to safety concerns amid a full-scale invasion of her country.

She shared pictures of empty supermarket shelves. Although she said she stocked up on food and water, she doesn’t see an opportunity to resupply.

""I went out to the store to replenish our supplies,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""But the store shelves are empty. The store warehouses are just as empty. New supplies are now impossible.""

And in Kyiv, a Russian missile strike on a civilian TV tower killed at least five people near the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial.

Militia members also told Fox News Digital Wednesday that a Russian rocket aimed at the Ukrainian army general’s staff was intercepted by Kyiv’s air defenses – sending a piece of debris crashing to the ground near the city’s crowded central train station. The area had been packed hours earlier with hundreds of women, children and elderly residents hoping to flee before an expected Russian assault.

Evidence is growing of the possibility of an upcoming Russian amphibious assault operation near the port of Odesa, on Ukraine's Black Sea coast, according to defense analysts.

Imagery has been circulating of a large flotilla staged off Crimea, including as many as eight Russian tank landing ships. These assets were previously used for a landing between Berdyansk and Mariupol, and Fox News reports that U.S. officials believe that the task force is headed for Odesa next.

This would align with an apparent public disclosure of Russian military planning. On Tuesday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko - who has assisted the Russian invasion from the north - displayed a campaign map suggesting an attack in or near Odesa during a televised presentation. The map showed a sweep from Odesa to the northwest, linking up with the Russian-controlled territory of Transnistria in eastern Moldova (highlighted below).

Analysts have previously suggested that the assets available to the Russian Navy are not sufficient to launch an opposed landing at a major strategic target like Odesa. Each of the tank landing ships presently moored off Crimea can deliver a mixture of tanks, armored personnel carriers and troops directly to shore, with tradeoffs. The flotilla available could deliver a force equal to two batallion tactical groups - equivalent to about 1,500-2,000 soldiers - and analyst H.I. Sutton suggested Thursday that this would not be enough to subdue a city of Odesa's size on its own. It is possible that the force is aimed at a point to the west or the east of the city itself, consistent with previous practice.

In Odesa, the civil defense is working to prepare for the arrival of Russian forces, whether from the East - from Kherson, which fell to the Russian attack on Wednesday - or from an amphibious assault near the city itself. Workers have welded up sections of scrap steel and railroad track into tank barricades to blockade roads, and residents have helped fill and transport sandbags to fortify defenses, according to the New York Times.

In Nikolaev, which has come under attack as Russian forces advance east, the Ukrainian Navy has scuttled the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny to prevent its capture. The majority of the Ukrainian fleet was seized by the Russian military during the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the Sahaidachny was Ukraine's largest remaining naval asset.

Russian forces have steadily advanced in southern Ukraine, seizing the ports of Kherson and Berdyansk and surrounding the port of Mariupol. On Thursday night, Russian forces fired upon the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, sparking a fire.

The plant - he largest facility of its kind in Europe - came under assault by Russian forces on Thursday evening, and a fire started inside the building after a sustained period of shelling. One reactor unit has been shut down as a safety precaution. Firefighters and first responders were reportedly unable to access the scene for at least an hour due to ongoing combat.",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-officials-predict-an-amphibious-assault-off-odesa

Russian forces may be approaching Odesa from land instead of sea, a defense official told reporters Friday.

Forces came up through Crimea and to the Ukrainian port city Kherson and are now moving toward the port city of Mykolaiv, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said during a briefing Friday afternoon.

Mykolaiv is not far from Odesa, Kirby said, which suggests the Russians might make an assault on Odesa through Mykolaiv.

“We don’t know exactly what to make of that,” Kirby said. “We can’t assert for sure that the Russians are going to use a land route to assault Odessa or even if they’re going to move on Odessa. We’re just kind of watching this day by day as you guys are.”

Kherson is the first city to fall under Russian control since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. It is a population center and lies on the Dnieper River, which flows into the Black Sea.

“It’s a key port city in that regard, just in general, and certainly allows Russians, the Russian military to have a measure of control over at least that part of the river and the entrance into the Black Sea,” a senior defense official told reporters Friday morning.

But taking Kherson may have been so that the Russian could launch an assault on Mykolaiv, the senior defense official said, allowing them more access toward Odesa, should the Russians choose to attack it.

It is possible that a potential assault on Odesa will play out like the Russian’s attack on Mariupol, with ground forces reinforcing those coming from an amphibious landing assault, the senior defense official said.

Earlier in the week, a photo of the Belarusian president showing a map of attack plans suggested an amphibious assault on Odesa, but that has not yet played out. Right now, there are no signs of an amphibious assault about to launch on Odesa, the defense official said.

“I can’t assert for sure that they are planning to do yet another amphibious assault, whether it’s towards Odesa or any other southern Ukrainian port, but we’re watching it as best we can,” he said.

Although Russia has ships in the Black Sea, as part of its Black Sea fleet, its navy has taken a largely supporting role in the conflict, outside of an amphibious landing along the coastline near Mariupol in the first few days of the invasion.

Russian ships in the North and Pacific fleets will likely play no role in the Black Sea as Turkey closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to warships.

Russia launched an amphibious assault outside of Mariupol a week ago, with Russian troops still advancing on the port city.

“We have observed Russian forces continue to advance on Mariupol. But we don’t assess that they’re in there,” a senior defense official said.

The Russians are bombarding the city, with reports of water and utility outages, he said.

“And as we said before we continue to believe that the Russians want to move on Mariupol from the north out of the Donetsk region, as well as moving up that coast of the Sea of Azov,” the senior defense official said.

The Russian forces are using the coastline to move out of Crimea, the official said in a briefing Wednesday.

“How much of the Sea of Azov coastline they control? I don’t know,” he said.

Little has been said about the Ukrainian Navy, outside of a picture of its flagship scuttled that spread on social media on Thursday. According to London-based The Times, the commanding officer of Krivak III-class frigate Hetman Sahaidachny (U-130) received order to scuttle the ship to avoid losing it to the Russian forces if they carried out an assault in Odesa.

Odessa is also an administrative centre of the Odessa Oblast and a multiethnic major cultural centre. Odessa is the third most populous city in Ukraine and is alternatively known as the ""pearl of the Black Sea, ""the ""South Capital"" (under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union), and ""Southern Palmyra"".

The predecessor of Odessa, a small Tatar settlement, was founded by Haci I Giray, the Khan of Crimea, in 1440 and originally named after him as ""Hacibey"". After a period of Lithuanian control, it passed into the domain of the Ottoman Sultan in 1529 and remained in Ottoman hands until the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792.

In 1794, the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the Empress Catherine the Great. From 1819 to 1858, Odessa was a free port. During the Soviet period it was the most important port of trade in the Soviet Union and a Soviet naval base. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years.

During the 19th century, it was the fourth largest city of Imperial Russia, after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Warsaw. Its historical architecture has a style more Mediterranean than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles. Some buildings are built in a mixture of different styles, including Art Nouveau, Renaissance and Classicist.

Odessa is a warm-water port. The city of Odessa hosts both the Port of Odessa and Port Yuzhne, a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, Illichivsk, is located in the same oblast, to the south-west of Odessa. Together they represent a major transport hub integrating with railways. Odessa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to Russian and European networks by strategic pipelines.

Odessa

Overlay image (Before and After)

This week, our tour of European cities takes us over the major city of Odessa in the south of central Ukraine, which is capital of Odessa administrative region. Odessa is the main trading and fishing port of the country and its harbour is kept open all year round, with the use of ice-breakers in winter. It is also a major industrial city, a cultural centre (with several museums and theatres, and an opera house), and owing to its milder climate, a popular resort.

The city being a rail junction helps Odessa with some of its exports:

Petroleum

Processed food

Fertiliser

Chemicals

Plastics

Pharmaceuticals

Machinery

Clothing

Odessa also is a centre for higher learning, with a university, polytechnic, medical schools, marine academy and a music conservatory.

A colony from ancient Greece may have occupied the site of the city once, and Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century. Odessa itself was founded in 1794 as a Russian naval fortress on territory annexed from Turkey in 1792. By the early 19th century, the Russian settlement had become an important grain port.

During the Crimean War, Odessa was bombarded by both French and British naval forces. In 1905, the city was the site of a workers' uprising; supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin. Odessa suffered heavy damage during The Second World War, when it was occupied from 1941 to 1944 by German and Romanian forces. During the occupation, many civilians were killed by the occupying forces.

These images were acquired by the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites over thirty-one years and aims to show the difference from 1985 until today in Odessa. In these two images, using this comparison, you can see the changing urban development to the west of the city and in the harbour area, where new infrastructure has been built.

Another aim of these images is to promote the opportunity to download Landsat data through the ESA portals, where images captured every day are made available in near real time to the users and the scientific community.

The Russian military continues to face stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces units, as well as protests and civil disobedience from average civilians, but it has also made some gains. While its massive convoy north of Kyiv is stalled, it looks like a beach landing in the southern seaside city of Odessa may be imminent. Before getting into the latest news below, you can first get up to speed on previous developments in the conflict in our earlier rolling coverage here.

The Latest:

UPDATED: 8:00 AM EST—

The demise of the mighty An-225 super-heavy airlifter, which had been feared in previous days, appears now to have been confirmed beyond doubt. Footage that appeared today on social media shows apparent wreckage of the airlifter — including the nose, one of the port engines, and possibly the tail fin — burning in the aircraft's hangar at Gostomel Airport, which came under fierce Russian attack earlier in the campaign. The video is thought to have been made sometime during February 26-27.

Manufacturer Antonov, which also operated Gostomel Airport, had previously indicated that it required further information before making a determination on the final fate of the aircraft. In a tweet today, the company seems to hint that the sole An-225 has, indeed, been written off.

Meanwhile, losses of military aircraft in the fighting continue, with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense confirming the loss of another Su-27 Flanker fighter jet in the campaign, although it's unclear when. The pilot of the jet, Maj. Stepan Choban, was killed although during the battle he reportedly ""distracted enemy aircraft"" over Kropyvnytskyi, in central Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has now signed a decree awarding Choban the title of Hero of Ukraine. The announcement follows previous news of the death of another Ukrainian Su-27 pilot, Col. Oleksandr Oksanchenko, which you can read about here.

Evidence of what appears to be another Russian aircraft loss over Ukraine has also emerged, although so far it's not possible to confidently identify the aircraft in question, while the date and location of the incident are also unclear. What we can see beyond doubt are a flying boot, part of a helmet, and a fragment of the aircraft with the insignia of the Russian Aerospace Forces.

Unconfirmed reports claim that a Russian Su-34 Fullback strike aircraft was downed near Volnovakha in Donetsk Oblast earlier today and there has been speculation that the above wreckage might be from an aircraft of this type:

Elsewhere, Russian airpower appears to be involved in attacks that are also causing substantial destruction in civilian areas of Ukraine. According to the governor of the Chernihiv region, Viacheslav Chaus, a Russian airstrike today killed at least nine people and wounded four more. The raid apparently hit two schools as well as private houses.

UPDATED: 4:20 AM EST—

Eight Russian amphibious landing ships have been filmed sitting right off the western shore of Crimea. These likely include some of those we tracked from the Baltic Sea leading up to the invasion. Clearly, this is an ominous sign. Many think Odessa will be their destination:

There are unconfirmed reports that Ukraine's armed forces have mined the beaches at Odessa in advance of what seems to be an impending beach assault.

The latest UK general intel assessment:

The mechanized massive column north of Kyiv has become a tactical oddity. Thick mud off-road has made moving off paved surfaces very treacherous. The fact that Ukrainians are going out to engage the convoy (or should we call it a linear encampment now?) is telling. A source told The War Zone today that it has become Moscow's ""great vehicular bucket line of a logistical mess."" That's isn't to say that its very existence isn't highly troubling, but the longer it stays static the more risk it will be of creating its own terrible logistical and tactical issues. Fuel, for one, could become a major concern.

POSTED: 7:10 PM EST—

Though the strategic southern Ukrainian city of Kherson remained contested on Wednesday, its government now appears to have capitulated to invading Russian forces. The New York Times' Michael Schwirtz says that Mayor Igor Kolykhaev told him that he had met with a Russian commander in the area who planned to establish military occupation administration.

“I simply asked them not to shoot at people,” the Kherson Mayor had said in a statement, according to the AP. “We don’t have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE.”

Kolykhaev had earlier said that his city, which is located in a highly strategic position on the northern bank of the Dnieper River, was surrounded and that Russian troops were seizing control of buildings. Russian forces were also observed in the city earlier in the day apparently looting stores, possibly for supplies. There have been consistent reports that the Kremlin's invasion force, as a whole, has been suffering from significant supply chain problems, including when it comes to food and fuel.

With those logistical difficulties in mind, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has now called upon all Ukrainians to try to destroy Russian logistics convoys to hamper the Kremlin's invasion plans.

The mayor of Ukraine's port city of Mariupol, which lies on the coast of the Sea of Azov north of the Black Sea, has said the situation there is increasingly dire. Russian forces have it encircled and have been subjecting it to regular artillery bombardment and other attacks. Taking Mariupol will help solidify the Kremlin's gains in this area, which are key to fully securing a landbridge between western Russia and occupied Crimea.

The U.S. military says that it has delivered hundreds of Stinger shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to its Ukrainian counterparts in recent days, including a shipment of 200 just on Monday. Stingers and other MANPADS being sent to Ukraine from various countries are essential for helping the country's military to continue to contest the skies overhead. As of Wednesday, the Pentagon assessed that Russian forces had still not achieved air superiority in support of their invasion.

Spain has now joined a growing number of countries that plan to send weapons and other military aid to Ukraine. The Spanish government currently plans to send a shipment of machine guns, grenade launchers, and ammunition.

The Russian government, which has been facing increasing criticism over its invasion and the tactics it has been employing, including indiscriminate strikes on cities that may constitute war crimes, says that it is preparing to send humanitarian aid convoys to Ukraine.

The Pentagon says it has postponed a scheduled test launch of an unarmed LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in order to avoid doing anything that could ""be misunderstood or misconstrued"" by the Kremlin in light of current tensions. U.S. military officials have consistently said that they have not observed any significant changes to Russia's strategic force posture since President Vladimir Putin ordered them to adopt a state of heightened alert this weekend. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said that delaying this launch, which is a routine test done to demonstrate the functionality and reliability of the Minuteman III system, is prudent and does not diminish America's nuclear deterrent capabilities.

Sweden says that two Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jets and a pair of Su-24 Fencer swing-wing combat jets violated its airspace in the Baltic Sea today. Though not directly related to the conflict in Ukraine, the incident underscores the broad uptick in regional tensions.

A luxury yacht belonging to Alisher Usmanov, a Russian oligarch, was reportedly seized in Germany for unspecified reasons. Forbes reported that this was likely related to the freezing of Usmanov's assets under new sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

London based LBC News has already reported people in Odesa placing sandbag fortifications on the beach to try and stave off a Russian attack. The city on Ukraine's southern coast has nearly a million residents, and thus far, hadn't been attacked due to bad weather.

Russia is pressuring Ukraine despite not being able to capture the capital, Kyiv. It has made significant progress already in severing Ukraine's connection to the Black and Azov Seas. This began with the fall of Kherson, and currently, Mariupol is under siege, with the situation being described as critical.

Meanwhile, the second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian diplomats are underway, after the first talks failed. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has remained staunch in his belief that Ukraine will hold off a Russian attack and has announced the arrival of 16,000 foreign fighters to bolster the existing Ukrainian troops. He himself has refused offers from the US to evacuate, saying he needs ammo, not a ride.

On the other side, Russian President Vladimir Putin has remained determined about his goals for Ukraine. It must demilitarize and take a neutral stance when it comes to NATO.
