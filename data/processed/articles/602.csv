3,134107e0-38ad-49e2-b8eb-f7f479b801c0,[],2022-03-08 00:00:00,"The United Nations has denied claims that it has banned staff from using the words ""war"" or ""invasion"" to describe the conflict in Ukraine.

According to a leaked email, UN employees were instead reportedly told to use ""conflict"" or ""military offensive"".

New documents unveiled by The Irish Times on Wednesday claim that instructions were passed down from top-level officials within the UN, soon after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba shared the reports on social media and said the UN's reputation was ""at stake"".

Senior spokespeople at the UN have repeatedly denied the media reports and said the claims were ""false"".

""No such official communication has gone out to global staff to refrain from using certain words,"" said Melissa Fleming, who leads global communications for the UN.

She later admitted that an email had been sent to ""about 25 staff"" but that it had been clarified.

Fleming also referred to an earlier tweet from UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, which used the words ""war"" and ""invasion"".

Russia has always referred to the war in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"", and the country's state media regulator Roskomnadzor has cracked down on the words that news outlets can use.

Russian citizens now also face up to 15 years in prison if they intentionally spread claims about Russia's military that are deemed to be ""fake"".

Russia holds one of the five permanent seats on the UN Security Council, and some countries have expressed concerns about the power of large nations within the international body.

UN secretary-general spokesperson: 'It is simply false'

An email seen by Euronews seems to advise staff and issue guidance on ""communicating about Ukraine"".

""International civil servants have a responsibility to be impartial. It is particularly important during a crisis such as this one,"" the email reads.

But a deputy spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General has denied that any policy on wording existed.

""It is simply false to say that there was any policy to use certain words (like 'military operations') to describe the situation in Ukraine and to avoid others (like 'war' and 'invasion'),"" a statement to Euronews read.

Ukraine's foreign affairs minister had said it was ""hard to believe"" that the UN had also censored discussion over Russia's invasion.

""I urge the UN to swiftly refute such reports if they are false,"" Kuleba tweeted.

The UN spokesperson's official Twitter account initially said the Irish Times report was ""fake"" but later deleted the tweet.

""It is simply not the case that staff have been instructed not to use words like 'war' and 'invasion' to describe the situation,"" Fleming said.

Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the Secretary-General, added that the UN had issued no instruction to staff.

""There is a mistaken impression that UN staff were told to avoid using certain words to describe the situation in Ukraine,"" Dujarric said in a statement.

""At the same time, I would remind you that the staff of the United Nations are international civil servants and uphold the responsibilities that that position entails,"" he added.

""Accordingly, staff are asked to frame any communications on Ukraine as well as other political matters in a manner that is consistent with the position of the organization and the statements of the secretary-general.""

""This applies not only to the ongoing situation in Ukraine but other situations around the world.""

In a UN daily press briefing on Wednesday, Dujarric said of the allegations that ""people are looking for conspiracies where there is no conspiracy.""

""If the Secretary-General uses language, staff who work for him can use that language"", Dujarric said referencing previous tweets by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres.

'There's a heap of evidence,' says Irish Times

The Irish Times has reiterated that it has seen evidence that UN staff were instructed to avoid using the words ""war"" or ""invasion"".

Europe correspondent Naomi O'Leary told Euronews that there is a ""heap of evidence"" that UN workers were sent this order.

""I now have a paper trail that not only was this email sent, but it was the latest in a constant stream of instructions ... telling staff to moderate their language,"" she said.

""This is clearly something that was centrally coordinated and communicated top-down.""

The Irish Times has suggested that the UN may have performed a rapid u-turn on policy and retracted its instructions to staff overnight on Monday.

The news outlet had also reported that UN staff have also been banned from ""adding the Ukrainian flag to social media profiles or websites"".

O'Leary told Euronews that she had been contacted by ""outraged"" and ""appalled"" UN staff after the organisation had denied the claims.

""There was shock among the staff that received this email ... this was an interpretation of neutrality which for staff members went too far,"" she added.

""Among staff, there is a feeling that the organisation has gone excessively conservative to point where it is actually obstructing its work.""

Euronews is working to verify the reports further. The United Nations has not directly refuted claims that either an email existed or that such instruction may have come from the UNSG office.

The U.N. spokesperson later disputed the claim, but not before Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba condemned the rumors himself.

I lead @UN communications. No such official communication has gone out to global staff to refrain from using certain words. https://t.co/RVOZakUqH1 — Melissa Fleming 🇺🇳 (@MelissaFleming) March 8, 2022

It is simply not the case that staff have been instructed not to use words like “war” and “invasion” to describe the situation. In fact, on Monday, the head of political affairs @DicarloRosemary tweeted this: https://t.co/V6cCTl2YDx — UN Spokesperson (@UN_Spokesperson) March 8, 2022

The controversy stems from a Monday email shared with Irish journalist Naomi O'Leary that purportedly requests U.N. staff refer to the Russian attack as a ""conflict"" or ""military offensive,"" rather than a ""war"" or an ""invasion,"" for reasons of political sensitivity, the Irish Times reports. The email also asks staff to refrain from adding the Ukrainian flag to personal or official social media accounts or websites.

After the story broke, the U.N. reportedly told O'Leary that it does not ""dispute the validity of that email but it can not be considered official policy to staff.""

Fact-checking website Snopes was told by spokesperson for the secretary-general Stephane Dujarric that Secretary-General António Guterres ""has used a wide range of words in his statements and remarks to the press to describe what is going on.""

When Snopes asked for a copy of the email obtained by the Irish Times, ""[t]he spokesperson told us that while he does not doubt the existence of an email that was said to be sent out, there there was no such communication sent from headquarters.""

O'Leary later shared a message she had allegedly received from an ""ashamed"" U.N. employee, thanking her for reporting on the issue.

From a UN employee: ""As an employee of one of the UN agencies I was shocked three times with this guidance - first time when we received the advisory, then when it was retracted... and the last time, when our ombudsman blatantly lied to you on twitter.""

7,134107e0-38ad-49e2-b8eb-f7f479b801c0,[],,"In early March 2022, the United Nations banned its staff from using the word “war” in reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The U.N. as an entity did not ban the word “war.” The Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General at the United Nations in New York told Snopes that no such email had been sent to staff from U.N. headquarters, and provided multiple examples of senior U.N. officials using the word ""war"" in reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The U.N. Regional Information Centre for Western Europe at the Department of Global Communications issued guidance via email on March 7, 2022, to avoid using the word ""war"" until the U.N. had an official policy. However…

Editor’s Note: Since the original publication of this article, The Irish Times revised its initial story, dropping the claim that the U.N. had “banned” used of the words “war” and “invasion.” Then, on March 9, the Times published a follow-up story reporting that “new documents reveal top-level UN policy setting soft language on Ukraine.” (All three articles have been archived at the links above.) The March 9 follow-up piece included the following additional information: A Feb. 25 email from a senior official in the Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy United Nations Development Programme instructed colleagues that “The SG [secretary-general] has decided to use the phrase ‘military operations’ (not invasion or incursion)….” (We note that Feb. 25 was the day immediately following Russia’s initial attacks on Ukraine, when U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres himself had already said in public remarks: “What is clear for me is that this war doesn’t make any sense.” The Feb. 25 email, as excerpted by the Times, did not instruct recipients to avoid the word “war.”)

A “key messages” email sent to senior staff by the U.N.’s under-secretary general for political and peacebuilding affairs on Feb. 26 did instruct recipients to use specific phrases such as “military offensive” and “conflict” in reference to the two-day-old incursion. (We note that in the excerpt quoted in the Times, it does not appear that the email specifically instructed recipients to avoid saying “invasion” or “war.”)

Regarding the March 7 “key messages” email (the one that prompted the Times’ initial coverage), U.N. staff members who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity reportedly said that it was “understood by those who received it” to constitute a ban on using the words “war” and “invasion.”

According to U.N. spokesperson Melissa Fleming (whose tweets were quoted by the Times), the March 7 email “only went to about 25 staff” and “does not represent the official position of the organisation.”

A new email sent to U.N. staff the following day (March 8), according to The Times, appeared to be a correction of the March 7 email, stating that “approved key messages now refer to ‘war’ and/or ‘invasion.'”

On March 8, 2022, the Irish Times reported that the United Nations (U.N.) banned its staff from using “war” or “invasion” when referring to Ukraine in what the publication said was a “move to balance political sensitivities as powerful member state Russia cracks down domestically on those who use the words.”

An email that was reportedly distributed to staff the previous day advised employees to instead use “conflict” or “military offensive” to describe the invasion.

“[Use] ‘conflict’ or ‘military offensive’ and NOT ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ when referring to the situation in Ukraine,” the publication reported the email as having read. The email also reportedly banned staff from adding a Ukrainian flag to social media profiles or websites, which has become a symbol of solidarity.

“This is an important reminder that we, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the email reportedly read. “There is a serious possibility of reputational risk that has been flagged by senior officials recently.”

In a tweet posted the same day, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba called upon the U.N. to “swiftly refute such reports if they are false.”

It’s hard to believe that the UN could essentially impose the same kind of censorship as the Kremlin imposes inside Russia now by banning the use of words ‘war’ and ‘invasion’ among UN staff. I urge the UN to swiftly refute such reports if they are false. UN reputation at stake. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 8, 2022

Snopes contacted the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General at the United Nations by phone. In response, we were told in an emailed statement that there is a “mistaken impression” that staff were told to avoid using certain words to describe the situation in Ukraine.

“It is simply not the case that staff have been instructed not to use words like ‘war’ and ‘invasion’ to describe the situation,” wrote Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. We were then referred to the below tweet shared on March 7 by Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo in which she directly referred to the situation as a “war.”

Nearly two weeks on, it is painfully clear that those suffering the most after Russia's invasion of #Ukraine are civilians – killed, wounded, displaced. This war is senseless. We are ready to support all good-faith efforts at negotiation to end the bloodshed. — Rosemary A. DiCarlo (@DicarloRosemary) March 7, 2022

Similarly, we were told that the Secretary-General has “used a wide range of words in his statements and remarks to the press to describe what is going on.”

“At the same time, I would remind you that the staff of the United Nations are international civil servants and uphold the responsibilities that that position entails,” added Dujarric.

“Accordingly, staff are asked to frame any communications on Ukraine as well as other political matters in a manner that is consistent with the position of the Organization and the statements of the Secretary-General. This applies not only to the on-going situation in Ukraine but other situations around the world.”

Snopes asked for a copy of the email that was purportedly sent to staff and referenced in the Irish Times. The spokesperson told us that while he does not doubt the existence of an email that was said to be sent out, there there was no such communication sent from headquarters, and senior U.N. officials have themselves used the word “war” in their reference to the situation.

“There was an email that went to all staff reminding them of their responsibilities as international civil servants in what they post on social media,” Dujarric told Snopes in a phone call. This was said to be a regular email that goes out to staff whenever there is a global crisis.

“U.N. staff by nature are very passionate, and this [email] was a reminder that they represent an organization, and there are certain standards to uphold,” Dujarric added. He noted that there may have been an email that was sent from a local manager, but the only official communication sent by the U.N. was the following statement, which we received via email:

Guidance to staff on personal communications about the situation in Ukraine The crisis in Ukraine is deeply upsetting and a matter of grave concern to United Nations staff. The Secretary-General has also made the position of the Organization regarding the hostilities very clear. While it is understandable that many of us feel compelled to share views about the events that are unfolding, including in personal fora such as social media, staff are reminded of their rights and duties as international civil servants, which require us to act independently and impartially. Please take a moment to familiarize yourselves anew with the policies on the Status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members; outside activities; and the guidelines for the personal use of social media. Attention is also drawn to the “2022 Guidance on Political Activities” recently issued on iSeek by the UN Ethics Office. Accordingly, staff are asked to frame any communications on Ukraine as well as other political matters in a manner that is consistent with the position of the Organization and the statements of the Secretary-General. Our hearts and minds are with all who suffer as we join the global community in its cry for peace.

Naomi O’Leary, Europe correspondent for the Irish Times who wrote the original article, contacted Snopes and forwarded screenshots of the email sent from Sherri Aldis, director of the U.N. Regional Information Centre for Western Europe at the Department of Global Communications. We were able to confirm that the email in question was sent to staff on March 7 with a subject line that read, “Ukraine crisis communications guideline.” The email further noted that it was “an INTERNAL document, and should not be shared.”

The section in question read:

Language elements: Some specific examples of language to use/not use at the moment: “conflict” or “military offensive” and NOT “war” or “invasion” when referring to the situation in Ukraine [please note we are waiting for updated guidance on specific terminology following the General Assembly resolution, which notably uses the word “aggression.]

“Ukraine” and NOT “the Ukraine”

“Kyiv” and NOT “Kiev” in English

Zelenskyy” and NOT “Zelensky”

The full email, in screenshots courtesy of O’Leary, is posted in its entirety below:

While it is true that an internal email from a branch of the U.N. advised staff to avoid using the word “war,” the U.N. as an entity did not officially or publicly ban the use of the word. Furthermore, several U.N. senior officials referred to the conflict directly as a “war” on social media. It appears that Aldis advised staff to avoid using the term “war” until official guidance was released by the U.N., rather than outright prohibiting them from doing so. As such, we updated the rating this claim from “False” to “Mixture.” (We have archived the original version of this article here.)

Following a public exchange between O’Leary and the verified account U.N. Spokesperson on Twitter, we followed up with the agency for further clarification as to the scope of the email recipients, and if the email went out to one department and not all of U.N. staff. We also asked the agency to forward the official policy once it is available. We will update the article accordingly.",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/un-ban-word-war-russia-ukraine/
8,134107e0-38ad-49e2-b8eb-f7f479b801c0,['Social Links For Mark Moore'],2022-03-08 00:00:00,"​The United Nations has advised its communications staffers against using the terms “war” or “invasion” to describe Russia’s attack on Ukraine, according to a report out Tuesday that has some questioning whether the international body is cowed by the Kremlin.

The Irish Times, citing a Monday email from the UN’s global communications department, reported that employees have been told to refer to the fighting as a “conflict” or “military offensive” — even as Russian troops target Ukrainian civilians and more than 2 million people flee to neighboring countries.

The email also included a warning not to add Ukraine’s distinctive blue and yellow flag to official or personal social media accounts, a gesture that has become a worldwide symbol of support for the country since the Russian invasion began Feb. 24.

The email, which was posted on Twitter by Irish Times reporter Naomi O’Leary, described the cautious policy as a way to avoid “reputational risk.”

“This is an important reminder that we, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the message said. “There is a serious possibility of reputational risk that has been flagged by senior officials recently.”

The email is striking​ly​ similar to Moscow’s recent edict that the war be called a “special military operation,” and raised concerns that the UN is going too far not to offend Russia, one of five permanent members of the body’s Security Council.

“Quite clearly this is not just any war, but an illegal war of aggression, that should be condemned from a height by all members of the UN and the UN itself,” Neale Richmond, a member of the Irish Parliament and the Fine Gael political party’s spokesman on European affairs, told the Irish Times.

“The fact is just because Russia is a big country that has an essential role in the UN, they’re influencing policy in a direction that’s simply false​,” he added.​​

Roskomnadzor, the agency that regulates Russian media, ordered local outlets to delete the words “assault,” “invasion” or “declaration of war” two days after the attack was launched. The Russian parliament then passed a new law imposing prison terms of up to 15 years and a fine of up to $14,000 for spreading “fake” news about the military, which led a number of international news organizations to go dark or suspend operations in Russia.

A spokesman for UN Secretary-General António Guterres told The Post he was not aware of the email and pointed to a Monday tweet by Rosemary DiCarlo, the American head of the body’s political and peacebuilding department, to indicate the policy was not universally binding.

“Nearly two weeks on, it is painfully clear that those suffering the most after Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine are civilians — killed, wounded displaced,” DiCarlo tweeted. “This war is senseless. We are ready to support all good-faith efforts at negotiation to end the bloodshed.”

Guterres himself avoided using the terms “war” or “invasion” in remarks to the media last week after the UN General Assembly voted to denounce Russia’s attack.
