This document presents evidence of war crimes for the fourth day of the invasion, covering the period 00:00-23:59 EET, February 27 2022, presented by Truth Hounds.

Intentional attacks on civilians and civilian objects

Targeted attacks by Russian troops against civilians in the occupied area in the south of Kherson Oblast continue. On the morning of 27 February, an elderly man on a bicycle was shot in the back in Nova Kakhovka.[1]

At the infamous railway crossing in Nova Kakhovka where civilians were previously attacked,[2] Russians shot a civilian car carrying a family of four. A man was killed, while his two daughters and his wife were injured.[3]

In the city of Berdyansk, which was occupied by Russian troops unopposed on 27 February,[4] Russian forces shot a local resident who refused to hand over his mobile phone to the occupiers.[5]

All these cases are obvious and gross violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), namely deliberate attack on protected (civilian) persons who did not take part in the armed conflict.

In Chernihiv, a rocket struck a cinema building on the city’s central square, where a youth centre was located. Chernihiv Regional State Administration noted that this was a rocket attack.[6] As a result of the impact, the building suffered significant internal damage.

According to the Secretary of Chernihiv City Council, Oleksandr Lomako, the target of the artillery strike was the Chernihiv City Council building. Instead, a pediatric dental clinic, a dental clinic, administrative buildings, and multistorey residential buildings were destroyed.[7] The city library was also damaged.[8] According to the Strategic Communications and Information Security Centre, 16 people were injured during the shelling in Chernihiv on February 27.[9]

Large-calibre artillery shelling of residential areas in the northern part of Kharkiv continued for the third day in a row. Shells struck the courtyards of multistorey buildings, near playgrounds, or directly in residents’ outbuildings.[10]

At 14:59 EET (UTC+2), on 27 February, the emergency fire service phoneline received a report of a fire in a four-storey apartment building in Zhuravlivka District in northeastern Kharkiv. It is reported that an artillery shell struck the building. As a result of the impact, five apartments and the roof of a house with an area of 400 square metres were set on fire. There is currently no available data concerning victims.

As a result of an artillery attack with unidentified weaponry, at least four private homes and cars were destroyed or damaged on the western outskirts of Kharkiv, in the village of Zalyutyne. There is currently no data concerning either victims or nearby military facilities.[11]

Around midnight on 27 February, artillery shelling began in the town of Izyum. As a result of the shelling, apartments, private houses, and cars were destroyed and damaged. There is currently no information about the victims [12].

On 27 February, the village of Kunye in Izyum District came under shelling. Shells struck the centre of the village and knocked down a school and a two-storey house nearby. This incident was reported on 27 February on the Instagram page of the television channel “Izyum TV”.[13] Information about the victims was shared by the Secretary of Kunye Village Council. Three people were killed during the shelling – two died immediately, one died in hospital. Two more people were injured[14].

On 27 February, Sartana, a village near Mariupol, was shelled again.[15] There is currently no information concerning victims. Mariupol City Council organised the evacuation of the elderly, women, and children from the village. At 17:00 the same day, Mariupol City Council announced an attempt by Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups to fire on a bus escorted by national police which was carrying residents of apartment buildings destroyed by Russian airstrikes on a residential area on Peremohy Avenue on the Left Bank. The Mayor of Mariupol reported on prompt response and the destruction of sabotage and reconnaissance groups.[16]

On 27 February, the head of Luhansk Regional State Administration, Serhiy Haidai, gave an update on the situation in the cities of Shchastya and Stanytsia Luhanska. He reported that these settlements remain occupied by troops of the Russian Federation, with communications cut off and without food provision.[17] It became known that during the battle for Volnovakha, as a result of shelling by the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR), all communications infrastructure and housing estates, as well as the otolaryngology department of the hospital were damaged. Now, 11 injured residents need to be assisted, communications need to be restored, and food and water must be delivered.[18]

Indiscriminate attacks that cause disproportionate military superiority in comparison to damage to civilians and civilian objects

The armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine is currently in an active phase. Truth Hounds therefore relies heavily on open-source information in this study. Documenters do not always have the confidence beyond reasonable doubt to establish the intent of attacks on civilian targets, in other words, it is not always possible to establish with certainty the presence or absence of military targets near affected civilian targets. Even assuming that, in the case of some of the shelling described above, legitimate military targets were located near civilian targets, the attacks still violated IHL as they were indiscriminate. It is impossible to imagine a military target that would justify an attack that would cause the kind of destruction that Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and the towns and villages around these regional centres suffered on this day. Thus, while the targets of some of the attacks described in the previous section have not yet been identified, the shelling still violated IHL due to the disproportionate potential military advantage compared to civilians and civilian objects.

Attacks on medical staff and medical facilities

A children’s dental clinic was shelled in the centre of Chernihiv,[19][20] as were adjacent buildings. Attacks against medical facilities violate IHL as long as they are not used as military facilities. It is important that the presence of individual soldiers in a medical institution does not turn such an institution into a military target. Accordingly, the documented case is a war crime.

Use of human shields

Almost from the beginning of the day, information began to appear concerning attempts by the military of the Russian Federation to use so-called human shields. That is to say, seeking to use buses carrying civilians provide cover for positions used to launch military attacks – civilians were led to believe that they were to be evacuated from areas where active hostilities were taking place.

The use of human shields is expressly prohibited by the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocol I, and customary international law. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court calls for the prohibition of using civilians to provide cover for military targets. It does not matter whether the civilians volunteered to be near the military or military facility. What matters is the very fact that civilians are used as protection from a potential attack on the military, military vehicles, and other military facilities.

If the preliminary information from Bucha, Kyiv Oblast and Kherson is confirmed, the use of civilians by the armed forces of the Russian Federation should be considered a war crime.

Private property capture

Between 10:10 and 10:35, on 27 February, Russian troops robbed a grocery store in the centre of the village of Makoshyne, Mena District, Chernihiv Oblast.[21] [22] [23]

As of 14:52, the Russian military robbed two more shops.[24]

A common rule concerning respect to private property in case of an armed conflict provides a ban on the capture of private property. This ban, among others, is enshrined in the Hague Convention of 1907. However, it is not absolute. The Hague Convention and customary IHL allows for the capture of private property when military necessity requires it. Therewith, it is expected that the value of the seized property will be compensated to the rightful owner. In earlier described cases, captured property can be theoretically considered as such if its seizure was necessary for a successful military operation by a side of the conflict. However, today there is no reason to think that seized property will be compensated. Property capture took the form of a robbery, not an organised seizure, because it was chaotic and unaccounted. Accordingly, we can consider it an IHL violation in terms of the inadmissibility of private property seizure and perhaps also a war crime.

Global crackdown on Russian state-affiliated media continues as Russia blocks Facebook

In response to the invasion of Ukraine, governments and corporations have implemented new regulations and policies to mitigate the reach of Russian state-affiliated media within their borders and on their services.

Notably, the Council of Europe filed a regulatory amendment that effectively bans two Russian state media outlets, RT and Sputnik. In response, Meta, TikTok, and Twitter announced that they would comply, restricting the outlets across their platforms in the European Union. At the same time, YouTube took similar measures, with company officials noting that it will take time to ramp up its efforts. RT and Sputnik content remains accessible on these services outside the European Union, although multiple platforms are taking steps to demonetize, de-rank, or add labels to limit their spread.

In China, popular social media platforms Douyin, Weibo, WeChat, and Bilibili announced they had begun to delete content, accounts, and comments spreading alleged misinformation, calling for war, or making vulgar remarks.

Globally, Apple and Microsoft announced that they would remove RT and Sputnik apps from their app stores outside of Russia, with Microsoft announcing limited distribution through its search and news services, as well as a ban from their advertising services. Spotify also removed these outlets from its platform and closed its Moscow office. Reddit, meanwhile, banned Russian state-media links and ads originating in and targeting Russia, as well as quarantined the subreddits r/Russia and r/Russianpolitics from the platform’s search results.

Online streaming and television providers have also begun to drop RT, with both DirectTV and Roku banning the content on their services, and Skynews halting distribution of programming. Meanwhile, Netflix refused to comply with a Russian government mandate to carry 20 state media channels.

According to a memo obtained by CNN, RT is closing its North American production studios and laying off most of its employees “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.” In an email, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan insisted on the trustworthiness of the outlet’s reporting and told readers that they are “strong and brave.”

The response from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, has been swift. It demanded that Google cease the distribution of allegedly false information about the ongoing invasion, faulted YouTube for sparking protests in the country, and requested that restrictions on the Russian football club PFC CSKA’s channel be removed. Roskomnadzor also called on Telegram to remove content regarding the Russian Armed Forces, and warned citizens against providing or distributing personal data online regarding relatives or friends in the military.

By March 4, Russia officially announced it had blocked Facebook. Roskomnadzor justified its decision by noting, “Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded. In recent days, the social network has restricted access to accounts: the Zvezda TV channel, the RIA Novosti news agency, Sputnik, Russia Today, the Lenta.ru and Gazeta.ru information resources.”

In a statement on Twitter, Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs, said, “Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out.”

BBC attempts to circumvent blocking by Russia

Following Russia’s blocking of the BBC’s online Russian service, the broadcaster re-upped its 2019 article on Twitter explaining how to access BBC reporting on the dark web in Ukrainian and Russian via the Tor browser, which helps internet users avoid government censorship and surveillance.

Reports of Russia cutting Web access to the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Deutsche Welle, were confirmed on March 4. According to the Guardian, the BBC website is “available at only 17% of normal levels in Russia.” Two days before its blocking, the BBC reported that the audience of its Russian language news website “more than tripled its year-to-date weekly average, with a record reach of 10.7m people.” The report added, “People in Russia are turning to BBC News in their millions for factual independent information about the war in Ukraine.”

RT en Español attempts to circumvent restrictions in Latin America

The Spanish version of Russian state broadcaster RT is trying to circumvent restrictions in Latin America after it was banned in Europe and ceased activities in the United States. On March 2, announced a change in its satellites, saying, “In many [Latin American] countries, TV shows were not available due to the massive restriction of RT’s signal.” Its website published information about the satellite changes for cable operators.

The broadcaster is also trying to teach its audience how to evade possible future restrictions by boosting its social media accounts. Inna Afinogenova, presenter of the YouTube Channel “Ahí Les Va” ( 1.1 million subscribers), suggested audiences should follow RT on traditional social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, as well as on Telegram, VK, and Odysee. Alternatively, she added, viewers could use VPNs to access RT content. Notably, Afinogenova used the word guerra (“war”) in the video, despite reports of the word being banned by Russian state media.

RT en Español is one of RT’s most popular language services on social media, with more than twice the number of Facebook followers than RT in English – 18 million followers versus 7.4 million followers, respectively. The invasion interrupted a downward trend in the number of RT Facebook followers, which previously peaked in December 2021. RT en Español’s Telegram channel has also experienced an increase in subscribers and views since Russia invaded Ukraine, with more than 160,000 subscribers at the time of publishing.

Belarusian resistance ramps up to oppose war in Ukraine

On March 3, a group of Belarusian protesters from the organization Women of Minsk were photographed openly protesting the invasion of Ukraine. The photo, shared by Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, shows six women with their faces covered, walking in Minsk. It is unclear if they were arrested. On the same day, the independent Belarusian media outlet NEXTA announced that Oleg Gruzdilovich, a Belarusian journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, had been sentenced to one-and-a-half years in a penal colony.

Courageous Belarusian women took a walk around Minsk protesting against the war in Ukraine – despite the risk of arrest.

On March 1, photos surfaced of an anti-war protester and a child in Minsk. Footage showed the protester being detained; the status of the child is unknown. The same day, news emerged of Belarusian protesters working to disrupt Russia’s movements in the country. These protesters, who refer to themselves as partisans, are reportedly former Belarusian policemen. The partisans reportedly burned control stations at Baranavichy and Gomel train stations, and shortened rail chains at Mahiliou station.

On March 2, a video emerged of a lone anti-war protester marching down a traffic-filled road in central Minsk. According to the report, the man was immediately arrested. Also that day, two partisans were arrested due to “terrorist activities,” and now face up to 20 years in prison. Meanwhile, videos of Belarusian volunteers forming military groups and joining the fight in support of Ukraine continue to emerge. The groups are fighting under the country’s former white-and-red flag.

Russian momentum continues in Ukraine’s south while stalling in the north

Russia’s momentum continues in the south while stalling in the north, as Ukrainian forces lose territory in the east. In each region, the impact of the war on civilians continues to worsen. With Russia increasingly reaching the new conclusion that Ukrainian cities will not be taken unopposed, instances of rocket, missile, and artillery attacks against civilian population centers have increased in multiple cities. The DFRLab previously reported on Russia’s use of cluster munitions against Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Other major cities like Chernihiv, Izyum, and Severodonetsk remain under consistent shelling, with graphic social media footage documenting the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian civilians. Russia is also tightening its siege of Mariupol, which will likely lead to a surge in civilian casualties.

Dead and wounded Russian fighters brought to Minsk

On March 2, reports and videos emerged of Russian ambulance convoys bringing wounded soldiers to hospitals in southern Belarus. The Wall Street Journal reported a “constant flow” of wounded Russian soldiers being brought to Belarusian hospitals.

This comes amidst reports that the morgues in Gomel and Mozyr are filled to capacity. Belarusian opposition representative Anna Krasulina alleged that most of the dead are Chechens whose remains are being “stored” to prevent Chechnya from calculating an accurate death toll.

Russian foreign minister and Kremlin media threaten nuclear war

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that if WWIII were to occur, it would be nuclear and destructive, according to Kremlin-owned outlet RIA. This follows an announcement last week from Russia that its strategic nuclear forces are on alert amid the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Kremlin media has justified the invasion into Ukraine with claims that Ukraine is creating a dirty bomb, intentionally misleading audiences that such a bomb would be the destructive equivalent of a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, a pro-Kremlin outlet published a map identifying potential US targets for a Russian nuclear strike, as other fringe outlets and forums have discussed ways to survive a nuclear explosion.

Russia broadcasts nationwide ‘lesson’ on ‘liberation mission’ in Ukraine

Russia’s Education Ministry broadcast a nationwide lesson titled “Defenders of Peace” on Thursday evening. The goal was to reach young Russians and inform them “in detail about the background of the events unfolding around Ukraine, explain the danger NATO poses to Russia, and help [people] learn to distinguish lies from the truth.”

According to Lenta.ru, more than five million schoolchildren watched the lesson dedicated to the “liberation mission in Ukraine.” The lesson highlighted the “common history, traditions, cultural heritages” between Ukrainians and Russians. In addition, the lesson stated that “residents of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea chose the side of Russia.”

Lenta.ru also reported a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurred during the broadcast, but did not result in any technical issues.

Meanwhile, Meduza reported that prior to announcing the nationwide lesson, the Russian government disseminated teaching guidelines to schools explaining why Russia’s “operation” in Ukraine “is not a war.”

Russian pro-war social media campaign fails to gain traction on Twitter and Facebook

Kremlin–controlled media reported on the emergence of an alleged grassroots campaign in support of Russia’s so-called “military operation” in Ukraine. Campaigners used the hashtag #МнеНеСтыдно (#IAmNotAshamed) to show their support for Russia. This comes after many Russian celebrities and citizens publicly stated that they were ashamed of their country’s invasion of Ukraine. As part of the campaign, people in Russia placed a zig-zag pattern resembling the letter “Z” on their vehicles, sheds, and windows to show support for Russian forces who have used this marking on their military equipment, likely used to avoid so-called friendly fire incidents.

Engagement with the campaign on Twitter was relatively minor, and the hashtag did not trend in Russia. In contrast, the hashtag #НетВойне (#NoToWar) previously trended on the platform, but has steadily dropped in mentions since February 24.

Activity around the pro-Kremlin hashtag on Facebook and Instagram was also modest, in terms of the number of posts published, when compared to anti-war hashtags. At the time of writing, there were only sixteen posts on Facebook and seventy-two posts on Instagram using the #МнеНеСтыдно hashtag. In contrast, there were thousands of posts using the anti-war hashtag #НетВойне, according to a query conducted using the monitoring tool CrowdTangle. On Instagram, however, the pro-Kremlin hashtag had on average more than twice as many interactions as the anti-war hashtag.

Polish extremists attack non-white refugees escaping Ukraine

As thousands of refugees from Ukraine cross the Polish border daily, Polish media reported that Polish far-right activists physically attacked non-Ukrainian refugees on March 1 in the border city of Przemyśl. Right-wing Twitter account @PrawaStronaa posted a video showing how Polish football fans chasing “black immigrants” in Przemyśl.

In parallel with these attacks, various actors on Facebook pushed false claims that non-Ukrainian refugees were committing crimes in eastern Poland. On March 2, the Facebook page Przemyśl Zawsze Polski (“Przemyśl Always Polish”) posted that economic migrants who came from Ukraine to Poland stabbed a young Polish woman and looted several shops. The post claimed that several local groups of football fans joined forces to “clean up the city” of undocumented migrants, supposedly receiving approval from the residents of Przemyśl. On March 4, the Facebook page removed this post. Grzegorz Braun, leader of the far-right party, Confederation in the Polish Parliament, openly supported the creation of such “Citizens Patrols” in Poland.

In response to rumors about crimes committed by non-Ukrainian refugees, Polish police tweeted they had not recorded an increased number of crimes after the refugee influx, and stated that such claims are not true. The DFRLab has previously reported that amid Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, social media accounts in Poland tried to revive anti-Ukrainian sentiments.

Russians fearing sanctions and prosecution seek to leave the country

Independent Russian media outlets Meduza, The Village, and Media Zona reported on the personal stories of Russians seeking to leave the country amid the war in Ukraine. Media Zona wrote about people’s experiences with Russian border control. Four out of six stories on Media Zona reported on involuntary mobile phone searches seeking out pro-Ukrainian Telegram channels, and questions testing travelers’ loyalty to the Kremlin. Meduza discussed the varying reasons for emigrating from Russia, including economic sanctions and fear of being prosecuted for dissent. The Village reported on the limited travel destinations and flights available for Russians due to the stiff sanctions imposed on the Russian aviation industry after Putin invaded Ukraine.

Some Russians have turned to online forums to discuss plans to emigrate. An unofficial poll conducted by the Russian portal TJournal revealed that 68 percent of respondents planned to leave Russia.

Some of the Russians who shared their stories with Meduza and Media Zona had departed for Georgia, Turkey, or Armenia, as these are easily accessible destinations. An increasing number of Russians are seemingly seeking refuge in Armenia and Turkey to escape prosecution, economic hardship, or European restrictions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Additionally, the DFRLab identified many posts on Facebook discussing opportunities to leave Russia. Similar posts were identified on Twitter.

New sanctions tighten grip on Belarus

On March 2, EU diplomats approved new sanctions against Belarus, including its timber, steel and potash industries. The sanctions reportedly will ban around 70 percent of all imports from Belarus to the EU. That same day, the US hit the Belarusian economy with sanctions restricting exports.

On March 3, International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Beijing Winter Paralympics. Initially the committee had planned to allow the athletes to compete under no flags, but changed its stance due to public pressure. On the same day, the World Bank announced that it will stop all its programs in Russia and Belarus effective immediately.

On the eighth day of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the major port city of Kherson fell to Russia, while other cities continued to suffer non-stop shelling. Within a week of the invasion, the picture of Ukraine had changed. While Ukrainians are bracing for an all-out assault, Russian warships are heading towards their next target -- the third largest city of Odessa.

KHERSON CAPTURED BY RUSSIA

Ukrainian officials, on Thursday, confirmed that Russian soldiers had taken over and captured the southern city of Kherson. Russian forces are intensifying their assault on other Ukrainian cities.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Vadym Denysenko said that Russian forces had entered Kherson. ""Ukraine still controls the city administration building,"" he said.

On Wednesday, it seemed that Russian forces had taken control of Kherson. However, Ukrainian officials did not comment on this.

KYIV IN FOCUS

A huge convoy of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles headed towards Ukraine’s capital Kyiv on Wednesday with the apparent aim of toppling the government and installing a new regime.

The city of nearly three million people is under attack; the days to come are likely to see even more explosions and casualties. And yet, Kyiv stands tall.

The city is still under Ukrainian control as the armed forces use different methods such as climbing on top of enemy tanks to slow down the Russian convoy’s advance.

TV TOWER, HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL HIT

On Tuesday, Kyiv’s main TV tower and holocaust memorial were hit by Russian shelling, killing five people and injuring five others as per Ukrainian officials. The blast briefly knocked TV broadcasts off the air. The TV tower is a couple of miles from Central Kyiv and a short walk from numerous apartment buildings.

The bombing came after Russia announced it would target transmission facilities used by Ukraine's intelligence agency. It urged people living near such places to leave their homes.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office also reported a powerful missile attack on the site of the Babi Yar Holocaust memorial near the tower. A spokesman for the memorial said a Jewish cemetery at the site, where Nazi occupiers killed more than 33,000 Jews over two days in 1941, was damaged.

KHARKIV HEAVILY BOMBED

Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, saw heavy bombardment on Wednesday even as Russia's invasion was denounced by the United Nations in a General Assembly vote. Dozens of countries sought probe into potential war crimes.

The biggest attack on a European state since 1945 has led to a barrage of economic measures against Russia. The war has stoked fears of wider conflict in the West.

1 MILLION UKRAINIANS FLED COUNTRY

The UN refugee agency says 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion. It is an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed.

The number of refugees, according to UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), amounts to more than two per cent of Ukraine's population. The World Bank put Ukraine’s population at 44 million at the end of 2020.

The UN agency has predicted that up to 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun a probe into possible war crimes committed by Russian soldiers and the government while invading Ukraine. This was announced on Thursday.

The ICC is investigating possible war crimes during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Barrage of sanctions

""For many millions more, inside Ukraine, it’s time for guns to fall silent, so that life-saving humanitarian assistance can be provided,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi said in a tweet.

Russia's attack has led to a barrage of international sanctions that threaten the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and stoked fears of wider conflict as Western countries send arms to help the Ukrainian military.

The U.S. State Department called on Putin and the Russian government to ""immediately cease this bloodshed"" and withdraw forces from Ukraine. It also accused Moscow of launching a ""full war on media freedom and the truth"" by blocking independent news outlets and social media to prevent Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

It denies targeting civilians although there have been widespread reports of civilian casualties and the shelling of residential areas.

Russians have shelled the city of Izyum, about 120 km (75 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, killing six adults and two children, Ukraine's parliament said. Reuters was unable to verify the casualties.

The U.N. Human Rights Office has confirmed the deaths of 227 civilians and 525 injuries during the conflict as of midnight on March 1, cautioning that the real toll would be much higher due to reporting delays.

An explosion also rocked the Kyiv railway station where thousands of women and children were being evacuated. The blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser said, and there were no immediate reports of casualties.

An investigation into possible war crimes will immediately be opened by the International Criminal Court, following requests by 39 of the court's member states, an unprecedented number.

International response

A U.N. resolution reprimanding Moscow was supported by 141 of the assembly's 193 members, a symbolic victory for Ukraine that increases Moscow's international isolation.

""More is at stake even than the conflict in Ukraine itself. This is a threat to the security of Europe and the entire rules-based order,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow still sought Ukraine's ""demilitarization"" and that there should be a list of specified weapons that could never be deployed on Ukrainian territory. Moscow opposes Kyiv's bid to join NATO.

Oil and commodity prices spiraled ever higher on Thursday in a grim omen for global inflation.

“We’re seeing a change in strategy from the Russian side … They’re less focused on encircling cities, more concentrated trying to go in,"" the unnamed official told CNN.

“[Heavier] bombardment is a side effect of that shift,” the official said.

Russia’s slow advance and heavy losses suffered in the first few days of its invasion have forced the change, the official said, with Russian forces now hamstrung by logistical issues as they attempt to push further into Ukraine.

“It’s the whole logistical chain that is somehow not working [properly],” the NATO official said. “So what we’ve seen is really poor strategy, combined with bad preparation and dwindling morale.”

“They have no food, they lack fuel and also spare parts,"" they added.

While a staunch Ukrainian resistance is largely responsible for stymying the Russian advance, the NATO official warned that the situation on the ground could change rapidly and that “expectations” should be “managed.”

7,559fadc7-9d7e-4790-8024-485579755073,['Current Time'],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.
