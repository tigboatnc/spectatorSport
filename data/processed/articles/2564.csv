Whitehead', 'Opinion Contributor']",2022-03-03 15:30:08+00:00,"A Russian missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv this week presented a jarring picture — a large building, a few cars, some pedestrians, suddenly engulfed in fire and smoke. Why was Kharkiv, known in Ukraine as an academic town, targeted in this way, rather than cities with more military value? One answer is Kharkiv’s recent transition from a town long considered “Russian” to one that reflects more Western and American ideals.

Since becoming a professor, I have been to Ukraine dozens of times, and on many of those trips, I have had the chance to visit Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city.

It’s a university town, known as “Science City” during the former Soviet years. About a quarter of its population are students, and a quarter more have ties to the city’s academic and research institutions. Much of the city revolves around academics, science, and study. Kharkiv’s sister city in the United States is Cincinnati, but to me, it always had the urban “college town” feel of Boston.

The building that was bombed was the administration center for the Kharkiv region. It looks out over Freedom Square, which is the largest public square in Ukraine and, perhaps, Europe. I have been inside that building a dozen times, and I have walked by it even more. My favorite ice cream store was just around the corner. There is absolutely no military or strategic value to that building.

So, why the vicious attack?

Kharkiv had always been a “Russian” town. Until 2014, when the fighting began in Donbass and Russia annexed Crimea, Kharkiv’s economy was directly tied to Russia’s. Most exports traveled East, and Kharkiv was a regular tourist destination for wealthy Russians traveling West. Everyone in Kharkiv speaks Russian, and for those born in the region, Russian probably is what they spoke first. The city is only 30 miles from the Russian border, and in the morning, most taxi drivers have their radios tuned to Russian stations. My friends in western Ukraine, who speak Ukrainian fluently, often complained about the grammatical errors in Kharkiv-prepared materials.

But that has changed in the last five years.

Kharkiv has begun to look to the West, which shouldn’t come as a surprise. Kharkiv’s youth grew up after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Their world, and its possibilities, stretches well beyond anything their parents or grandparents could imagine. You can see this in Kharkiv’s growing tech community. Tech-based businesses are an important part of Ukraine’s economy and, as an academic center, they play a greater role in Kharkiv’s life. Just a month ago, Ukraine’s minister of education visited Kharkiv to promote entrepreneurship in Kharkiv’s universities, meeting with university presidents in a newly renovated American-style incubator space in the heart of the city.

In other words, Kharkiv is no longer Russian.

The belief that you can shape your own future — build your own business, compete globally with others — is now a part of how Kharkiv sees its place in the world.

New businesses, based on university technology, look to develop products for sale in the West. American and European investors and partners see new opportunities in the teams that are creating them. And people in Kharkiv, who went by Russian names, now insist you refer to them by the Ukrainian equivalent.

Now firmly Ukrainian, Kharkiv is also more American, and that may be what threatens Mr. Putin the most.

People walking through a park forced to rush to safety as shells explode around them.

These were some of the attacks that residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, endured in recent days as Russian forces targeted residential areas, hitting civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches.

CNN has geolocated and verified 13 incidents involving civilians over the past three days, as attacks intensified on Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people. following Ukraine's resistance.

Most of the attacks took place in the northeastern part of Kharkiv in the residential area of Saltivka. But other districts in the northwest, southeast and southwest of the city were also affected. The city's Freedom Square, the center of public life in Kharkiv, was hit with was believed to be a cruise missile, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said.

In 24 hours, 34 civilians were killed and 285 injured -- including 10 children -- in the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said on Thursday morning.

As the Kharkiv offensive ramped up, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague announced on Wednesday that he had launched an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Russia's relentless bombardment of Kharkiv, including the deliberate targeting of residential areas with ""jet artillery,"" as a ""war crime"" in a late-night address on Monday.

CNN has analyzed and verified digital evidence, including videos and photos, of several indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv.

Three schools hit by shelling in one day

A giant hole is seen at School #17 in Kharkiv's Saltivka neighborhood after a Russian military strike on Tuesday.

At least three schools in Kharkiv were hit by Russian military strikes on Tuesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media.

In one clip, a school in the northern Saltivka neighborhood is pictured with a gaping hole in the wall, rubble and broken glass strewn across the courtyard.

""School number 17 of Kharkiv city,"" someone can be heard saying in the video. ""It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke.""

The other two schools hit in shelling were just over a kilometer (around 0.6 miles) apart, in an industrial district in Kharkiv's southeastern area.

Schools have not been in session since the Russian invasion began.

Other schools were indirectly affected during the bombing of the center of Kharkiv on Tuesday. Viktor Kruglov, the founder of Ranok, a private school, said they managed to evacuate about 54 orphans from a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children just 15 minutes before the explosion.

However, 65 people are still holed up in the basement of the school -- with no electricity or water due to the shelling. They're relying on food and water brought by volunteers, according to Valentyna Butenko, head of the non-governmental organization ""Right to Choose"" (Pravo Vyboru).

The school is located 300 meters (approximately 985 feet) from the epicenter of the explosion in Freedom Square.

Apartment blocks directly hit

First responders fight a fire at an apartment complex hit by Russian military strikes in Kharkiv on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, two apartment buildings were directly hit, just outside City Kharkiv municipal hospital No 3. The strikes also hit an office building.

In one video, a fire rages at a damaged apartment complex just across the street from the hospital.

""The building is gone,"" someone in the video says.

Another video shows children and family fleeing the apartment complex, and at least two bodies on the ground.

""...animals, simply animals,"" someone said, appearing to refer to those responsible for the military strikes. ""People were driving here.""

""A house,"" another person said, adding, ""Look at what they've done.""

CNN could not identify any military targets in the area.

Other footage from the Saltivka neighborhood, which was shared on local media, showed a row of shops in front of an apartment building destroyed by strikes. A nearby building was also seen on fire.

Security camera catches dramatic incident

Five residential neighborhoods of Kharkiv were hit on Monday, according to a CNN analysis.

What appeared to be surveillance-style footage of an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva Street captured panicked residents rushing for safety as rockets exploded around them.

Some of the videos showing Russia's indiscriminate bombing of homes in Kharkiv today are too graphic to share here.



This one, while not graphic, is haunting in its own right.

The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running away. One individual is seen falling to the ground as explosions dot the ground around. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. After the hail of strikes stop, the individual that fell appears to crawl away, but then stops moving. Their condition is unknown to CNN.

Apartment complexes on Klochkivska Street in northwestern Kharkiv, and on Vasylia Stusa Street in eastern Kharkiv were also hit on Monday.

Multiple-launch rocket system attack near supermarket

The Saltivka neighborhood was also hit by a multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS, attack on Monday.

Videos geolocated by CNN show multiple rockets exploding closely together near the Equator supermarket, while shoppers scramble to safety.

One video shows a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as some people look at it.

A missile is seen lodged in the ground outside a small grocery store in Kharkiv on Monday.

According to the Kharkiv City Council, that shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 wounded. The wounded are made up of 15 servicemen and 16 civilians, says the city council in a press statement. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.

Dan Kaszeta, a defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London, said the images were consistent with a multiple rocket launch system attack.

""The appearance of at least one image of a rocket booster section lends credence to this having been a rocket attack,"" he said.

Commenting on that attack, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, said: ""Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims.""

He described the situation as ""a nightmare.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-civilian-strikes-intl-cmd/index.html

KHARKIV, Ukraine, March 2 (Reuters) - On a residential street in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, debris was strewn all around, blood stained the ground and the bodies of people carried from destroyed homes lay covered in blankets.

Some survivors of the barrage by Russian forces sat silently where they could, staring at the carnage. Others helped rescue workers to search the rubble for anyone alive or dead, according to a Reuters witness.

The scenes in Ukraine's second-largest city this week were a reminder of the ferocity of the war in some parts of Ukraine.

While the outskirts of the capital Kyiv to the west have come under shell and missile attack, the fate of Kharkiv, which is geographically and culturally close to Russia, has so far been worse.

According to officials on Wednesday, in the last 24 hours at least 21 people have been killed and 112 wounded in the strategic eastern Ukrainian city, which lies just a few kilometres (miles) from the Russian border on major routes leading north to south and east to west.

Later in the day they said four more had died and nine were wounded as air and rocket strikes continued. Although under siege, Kharkiv has not yet fallen to Russian forces.

At the badly damaged apartment blocks, disbelief mixed with anger.

""They bombed the residential building, hit it with rockets. Many civilians died. I have videos of at least four dead people laying on the ground,"" said Vitaly Rybas, a local resident.

""A dead person is laying next to us. (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin are ... bandits. They should be brought to justice.""

Pools of blood stained roads and pavements as workmen sifted through the wreckage. Firemen and volunteers carried out two bodies wrapped in blankets from the charred stairwells of an apartment block. People peered into craters left by bombs.

""The Russians are shelling us,"" said Svetlana, who did not give her surname. ""We are all scared. Why us? We are ordinary folk.""

'ATROCITY' AGAINST CIVILIANS

Fierce fighting outside Kharkiv has helped hold up the Russian advance, according to Ukrainian officials, who shared footage on the day the invasion began that they said showed destroyed or disabled Russian military vehicles and the body of a Russian soldier.

Reuters could not verify the images independently.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the attacks on Kharkiv amounted to state terrorism, and described the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv as Russia's main targets.

Many Western governments have reacted with dismay to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and they hope that tough economic sanctions against Moscow will deter it from pressing ahead with what it calls a ""special operation"" to remove foes in Kyiv.

Events this week in Kharkiv, home to around 1.5 million people, have been singled out for special criticism. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday the scenes were reminiscent of Serbian shelling of Sarajevo in the 1990s.

""It has that feel to me of an atrocity committed deliberately against a civilian centre,"" he told a news conference in Estonia.

On Wednesday, long queues formed outside supermarkets and pharmacies as residents of Kharkiv emerged from homes and underground shelters to stock up on supplies.

""Everybody here is outraged,"" said Maria Zakharova. ""Our houses were bombed ... Us and our children ... We cannot even buy bread, can you see that?""

The day before, Russian forces struck at the heart of the historic city - the early capital of Ukraine after it was subsumed into the Soviet Union following World War One - hitting the regional administration building in central Freedom Square.

The blast gutted the imposing, Soviet-era structure and killed several people. In nearby streets, cars had crumpled under the weight of falling masonry. Outside a damaged shop, a Ukrainian and Russian flag fluttered side by side.

Kharkiv is one of the largest cities in Ukraine with a population of 1.5 million people. The city was founded in 1654 and from 1919 to 1934 was the capital of Ukraine.

In July 2020, the international portal Numbeo published a rating of the best cities in the world in terms of quality of life. Kharkiv took 183rd place, overtaking Kyiv.

The level of cities was assessed by prices for goods and housing, quality of medicine, transport links, and safety.

So, why is Kharkiv better?

Due to the fact that Kharkiv is located at the crossroads of trade routes, the city has been establishing transport communications for many years and most of the highways and railways lead to all industrial centers of Ukraine, Russia, and Europe.

New buses and metro provide connections around the city. Convenient interchanges allow people to quickly reach their destination. And the time of movement of transport is controlled by electronic boards at stops.

Kharkiv is an industrial city of Ukraine. After all, there are enterprises of mechanical engineering, radio electronics, aircraft industry, which are also known outside Ukraine.

Therefore, there are more jobs here and the population is professionally employed.

There are more than 20 groceries, clothing, and industrial markets in Kharkiv. The most famous among them are Barabashovo, Horse, Central. Therefore, Kharkiv is considered the center of trade not only for the city but also for Slobozhanshchina.

The city ranks second in Ukraine in terms of training the best specialists. On average, about 33 thousand specialists in various industries leave local universities per year.

Among the most famous educational institutions are Kharkiv National University named after Karazin, Kharkiv National Medical University, National Law Academy named after I. J. Wise, National Aerospace University.

Many gyms, playgrounds, swimming pools, and tennis courts are open to supporting sports.

For example, there are 19 stadiums in Kharkiv and the Metalist football team, which is the pride of the country.

The city is also rich in cultural attractions. In 2008, the competition “Seven Wonders of Kharkiv” was created, where the best monuments of the city were selected.

In addition to the old monuments, the city can boast of new buildings that fit perfectly into modern life.

Today Kharkiv is not only an industrial and industrial city but a modern metropolis created for business, where you want to live.

What about the rating in Ukraine?

A group of experts published the survey data and named the five cities where the standard of living is significantly higher than in other regions of the country.

According to the results of the study, Kharkiv is recognized as the best city for living in Ukraine.

This is the conclusion reached by the experts of the “Prizova Wart” project. The one and a half million megalopolis of the Ukrainian East topped the rating of the five best cities for life in the state.

“In order to select the top five cities, we used data from various studies, and also conducted our own surveys. The criteria for evaluating each of the cities were: the economic situation, the quality of education, the prospects for doing business, the safety of life, the level of wages, the comfort of transport, the environmental situation, as well as the quality of municipal services,” said the organizers of the survey.

According to the experts of Prizov Wart, Kharkiv has been demonstrating rapid development over the past three years. The first capital differs significantly from other Ukrainian cities in its cleanliness, landscaping, and street lighting. Guests of the city and the residents of Kharkiv are satisfied with the number of attractions, architecture, and places for entertainment and leisure. Another main criterion for a comfortable life in Kharkiv has become the education sector, in the city at a decent level and continues to develop rapidly.

But one of the main advantages of the second capital of Ukraine is that it has a high level of investment attractiveness. A huge number of both Ukrainian and foreign companies work here. This improves the economic performance of the city, as well as allows you to find good jobs with high wages.

The city of 1.5 million, according to experts, is currently one of the transport hubs connecting Ukraine with Europe. As for other Ukrainian cities that entered the TOP-5 of the best for life, Vinnytsia took second place after Kharkiv. Bronze went to Kyiv. The fourth and fifth places are occupied by Lviv and Odesa, respectively.",https://www.automotorpro.com/kharkiv-best-city-live-ukraine-why
4,a44c7d54-5e28-49af-8c34-1a08564ad5cd,['Anthony Brooks'],2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Powerful airstrikes continue to hit civilian targets in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Thursday, hitting at least three schools and driving residents into shelters.

Though there are no official numbers yet, security analyst and Kharkiv resident Maria Avdeeva says the toll is climbing and that no one in the city is safe.

For about two to three hours in the mornings before the airstrikes begin, Avdeeva heads downtown to video the destruction of buildings, homes and cars. She says during this period, the people of Kharkiv go out and get some food while they can. Once the air sirens go off, people scramble to get back to shelters, she says.

Currently, the Russian military is using airstrikes to target residential areas in Kharkiv — places with no military infrastructure. Airstrikes cause any nearby buildings and cars to be completely destroyed, with windows blown out and roofs taken off.

There’s no justification for these “purely civilian” bombardments, which greatly impact residents’ ability to safely leave the city and are causing severe food and fuel shortages, Avdeeva says.

“That is completely [a] war crime against the civilian population in Ukraine and in Kharkiv,” she says.

Interview Highlights

On whether Russian forces will take control of Kharkiv

“They tried to enter the cities, so there was an on-ground operation several days ago. But it failed because the city [fought] back fiercely, the Ukrainian military and also territorial defense units. I myself have seen the Russian military vehicles destroyed on the streets of Kharkiv, so it failed and apparently, Putin's plan of control over Kharkiv failed. And now Russian troops have got control over small villages and towns in the Kharkiv region, so outside of the city. They are now situated in the villages, which makes it impossible for an Ukrainian artillery to shoot and to shell them because they are hiding behind the Ukrainian civilian population.

“So what it looks like is that Putin probably will continue to use his troops to terrorize the city and wait until it has less resources, and probably it will be more and more hard for the population to survive here. But the morale of Ukrainian military is really high, and I only hear that with every Ukrainian child killed, the readiness and ability to fight is more and more hard because they want revenge for every Ukrainian killed.”

On what is known about casualties so far

“We don't have … any exact numbers. The mayor of Kharkiv says it is dozens of people, and today, he said the confirmed number of children killed by the strikes was four. But we don't have exact numbers because the bodies are still buried under the destructed buildings, so it takes time to get the exact numbers.”

On Russian soldiers in the region asking local Ukrainians to supply them with food

“Yes, we have seen that. And there are also videos of that where when [Russian soldiers] see the resistance, they very often put down their weapons because they are not ready to die for Putin and his ideas. So now, when they see what is happening and they've been captured on camera, they say that they had resources only for three days, meaning the resources of the food and supplies and the fuel supplies. And Russia was planning to end all operation [on] the 6th of March. That's what the Ukrainian military intelligence says. So now, when [Russian soldiers] are staying in the Ukrainian cities and towns, which they control at the moment, they do not have any supplies from Russian sides. It makes it difficult for them to be here. That gives much more chances for Ukraine.”

On why Ukrainians are calling for a no-fly zone to be imposed immediately

“Yes, that is what Ukrainian Civil Society is asking the international community to do. It's because we, Ukrainian army and citizens, are holding everything here on the ground. But what Russia now does, it now attacks our innocent cities from the sky, bombing houses and residential areas. So the no-fly zone over all Ukraine or even some areas of Ukraine will allow some safe place where people could go. People with children and with elderly [people] will find some safe place. So that means that if the NATO countries agree on that and establish that no-fly zone, so that will mean that Russia will not be able to make airstrikes and drop bombs in that area, and that area will be the area of safety for Ukrainian people.”

On whether Kharkiv feels safe

“No, I don't think that anyone in Kharkiv can feel safe right now because any moment and anywhere you can become the target for the airstrike attack and even in the bomb shelters, it's still, you know, uncomfortable to be hearing the air sirens going on. And it's already seven days since the war started, and people are exhausted because of that. But still, we are ready to fight and that's most important. So I see the determination in the eyes of people who are in territorial defense in our military and they are ready to be here and to protect Ukraine and our citizens. And that's why I'm staying here — because I don't want to leave the city. It's Russian soldiers who should go home.”

LEILA FADEL, HOST:

Russian forces have captured the southern port city of Kherson in Ukraine. It's the first city that's fallen since Russian forces invaded a little over a week ago. But they seem to be stalled north of the capital, Kyiv, where Ukrainian forces and volunteers are fiercely resisting. This as Russian missiles and artillery are firing on the city, as well as on Kharkiv to the northeast. Here to give us an update is NPR's Pentagon correspondent, Tom Bowman. Good morning, Tom.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.

FADEL: So, Tom, let's start with the capital. Russian forces are still north of the city's center, so roughly 20 miles or so. Why are they stalled?

BOWMAN: Well, first of all, they've been stalled for three days. And the reasons, we're talking logistics problems, food and fuel shortages, as well as the fact that the ground is not frozen. And the Russians are forced to stay on the roads. Of course, there's also resistance from Ukrainian forces, a resistance that, Leila, has surprised not only the Russians, but the Americans as well. There was a sense a few weeks ago in the Pentagon that Russian troops might grab Kyiv in - get this - as little as two days. Then there'd be this tough insurgency. But now Ukrainian forces and civilians are putting up a stubborn fight right now. And here we are a week into the invasion.

FADEL: I mean, we've seen all kinds of people signing up to go fight on the front line from here in Lviv. And of course, a lot of the combat power that we're seeing coming from the Russian forces is in the form of Russian missiles and artillery, right?

BOWMAN: Yeah, absolutely. Yesterday, we were told more than 450 Russian missiles fired so far, and many of them short range. And people I talked with in the Pentagon and elsewhere say this could only get more intense as the days go on, a much more aggressive missile and artillery fire from the Russians. We're already seeing that in Kyiv, but also in a city to the northeast of the capital, Kharkiv. Early on, the Russians were targeting military locations, so barracks, fuel and ammunition depots, airfields, for example. Now we're seeing, particularly in Kharkiv, more civilian infrastructure and residential areas being hit. Now, it could be those places are near military targets, Leila. Or it could mean a much more ugly phase now. We saw the Russians mount more indiscriminate attacks against civilian locations in places like Chechnya, as well as Syria - again, hitting more civilian targets.

FADEL: Right. Now in the south, the Russians appear to be making more headway, right?

BOWMAN: That's right. Russia already is occupying Crimea, of course. So Russian troops from there are moving into the fight. And also, Russia has landed several thousand amphibious forces on the coast. And they moved up to the city of Kherson, a city of some 300,000 just north of Crimea. And yesterday, the Pentagon was saying the city was still being contested. Now with the seizure of that city, Russian forces could either move north toward Kyiv or, perhaps, west toward Odesa on the coast. But at this point, we just don't know. Also, the Russians are pushing into other towns and cities in the southern part of the country and could head into the Donbas region. Now here's this - that's where half the Ukrainian army is located. And they could box them in.

FADEL: NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Thank you, Tom.

Dozens of people were reported dead or wounded yesterday after extensive Russian artillery fire on civilian targets in Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv.

At least 22 civilians have been killed in a Russian airstrike on the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Ukraine said, while Ukrainian forces are battling Russian troops for control of Enerhodar, which has Europe’s largest nuclear plant, the city’s mayor told various media outlets.

Meanwhile, Ukraine President Zelensky’s office said this afternoon the second round of talks with the Russians has begun over the war in his country. In Russia, Russia’s second largest – and largest private – firm Lukoil called for “soonest ending of armed conflict,” according to Interfax.

The peace talks began as French President Emmanuel Macron spoke for 90 minutes by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin this afternoon, who told Macron the war in Ukraine is “going according to plan”, a French official said.

The official at the French Elysee presidential palace said Putin told Macron the invasion will continue “until the end” unless negotiations meet his terms.

The announcement was made while Russian forces seized a strategic Ukrainian seaport and besieged another as part of efforts to cut the country off from its coastline.

The Russian military claimedit had control of Kherson, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed that forces have taken over local government headquarters in the Black Sea port of 280,000, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Meanwhile, Hungary’s government is insisting it will not allow any arms shipments bound for neighbouring Ukraine to cross its territory, as the European Union country receives tens of thousands of refugees from the conflict and frets about the reliability of its energy links to Moscow.

A large Hungarian ethnic minority, around 150,000 people, lives in the western Ukrainian region of Transcarpathia, just across the border.

The prime minister’s chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, says allowing weapons into Ukraine would endanger that minority. He added that some 120,000 refugees fleeing the conflict have crossed into Hungary so far.

Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague said early this morning it has opened an investigation after 38 countries, including the UK, referred Russia over what the Prime Minister described as “abhorrent” attacks.

The move came as Ukraine’s capital Kyiv braced for a siege while its second-largest city Kharkiv is reeling from strikes this morning and the control of port city Kherson was contested by the Russian military.

While according to the UN refugee agency, one million people have now fled Ukraine – making it the swiftest exodus of refugees this century.

The tally from UNHCR amounts to more than 2 per cent of Ukraine’s population on the move in under a week. The World Bank counted the country’s population at 44 million at the end of 2020.

ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said work would begin “immediately”, with his team already collecting evidence, after the co-ordinated referral freed him to get to work without the need for judicial approval.

UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the Russian president he “cannot commit these horrific acts with impunity”.

A second round of talks aimed at ending the fighting was expected on Thursday, but there were little hopes of a breakthrough.

Key developments so far today

The European Union announced that seven Russian banks were being excluded from the Swift system which allows fast and efficient interbank transactions.

The Russian defence ministry claimed that Kherson, in the south of Ukraine near the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, was under the “complete control” of Russian soldiers – but the Ukrainian military disputed this.

The price of oil continued to soar, reaching 112 dollars per barrel, the highest since 2014.

The lack of progress in meeting the aims of the invasion had led to a change in tactics, focusing on aerial and artillery bombardment of cities rather than the kind of lightning military advances originally envisaged by the Kremlin, Western analysts believe.

Strikes in Kyiv

Strikes that damaged the Babi Yar Holocaust memorial in Kyiv and the central square in Kharkiv have caused revulsion, and Western allies fear it is a sign of a shift in Russian tactics further towards the indiscriminate targeting of urban areas.

Moscow’s international isolation was further displayed when the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to demand it immediately withdraws its military from Ukraine, with 141 nations backing the motion and only five, including alleged co-aggressor Belarus, opposing it.

More than 2,000 civilians have died since the invasion began, Ukraine’s state emergency service said, although that figure has not been independently verified.

Fresh talks today

A second round of talks aimed at ending the fighting was expected on Thursday between Ukraine and Russia, but there appeared to be little common ground between the two sides.

UNHCR, meanwhile, predicted up to 4m people could eventually leave Ukraine but cautioned even that projection could be revised upward.

In an email, UNHCR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote: “Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark” as of midnight in central Europe (11pm London), based on counts collected by national authorities.

UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said Wednesday that “at this rate” the outflows from Ukraine could make it the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century”.

Russia reported its military casualties for the first time since the invasion began last week, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded.

Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses but said more than 2,000 civilians have died, a claim that could not be independently verified.

With fighting going on on multiple fronts across the country, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Mariupol, a large port city on the Azov Sea, was encircled by Russian forces, while the status of another vital port, Kherson, a Black Sea shipbuilding city of 280,000, remained unclear.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces claimed to have taken complete control of Kherson, which would make it the biggest city to fall yet in the invasion.

But a senior US defence official disputed that. “Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city,” the official said.

But the mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhaev, said Russian soldiers were in the city and came to the city administration building.

He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets.

“I simply asked them not to shoot at people,” he said in a statement.

“We don’t have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE.”

Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko said the attacks there had been relentless.

“We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop,” he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.

Convoy stalled

Meanwhile, the senior US defence official said the immense column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometres (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages and has faced fierce Ukrainian resistance, the official said.

On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteer fighters well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance.

“In my old age I had to take up arms,” said Andrey Goncharuk, 68.

He said the fighters needed more weapons, but “we’ll kill the enemy and take their weapons”.

Russia also pounded Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city with about 1.5 million people, in another round of aerial attacks that shattered buildings and lit up the skyline with balls of fire.

At least 21 people were killed and 112 injured over the past day, said Oleg Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration.

Several Russian planes were shot down over Kharkiv, according to Oleksiy Arestovich, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Kharkiv today is the Stalingrad of the 21st century,” Mr Arestovich said, invoking what is considered one of the most heroic episodes in Russian history, the five-month defence of the city from the Nazis during the Second World War.

From his basement bunker, Kharkiv mayor Igor Terekhov told the BBC: “The city is united and we shall stand fast.”

Russian attacks, many with missiles, blew the roof off Kharkiv’s five-storey regional police building and set the top floor on fire, and also hit the intelligence headquarters and a university building, according to officials and videos and photos released by Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.

Officials said residential buildings were also hit, but gave no details.
