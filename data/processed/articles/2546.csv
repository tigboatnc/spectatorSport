1,2234e8bf-c268-4b90-ae28-553b29b512da,[],,"Ukraine's military announced on Friday claimed that they had shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter jet near the city of Volnovakha in eastern Ukraine. Taking to Facebook, the Ukrainian General Staff said that the pilots of the plane were involved in carrying out severe bombings on civilians and infrastructures of the city. ""A Russian SU-34 fighter-bomber has just been shot down by a Joint forces air defence unit near the town of VOLNOVAKHA. The pilots of this plane carried out a barbaric bombardment of the civilian population and infrastructure of the city,"" said the top military official.

It is worth mentioning Sukhoi-34 is an advanced twin-engine, twin-seat, all-weather supersonic medium-range fighter-bomber/strike aircraft which was first inducted into the Russian Air Force in 2014. Though Russia denied using Su-34 in the war against Ukraine, it was first seen on March 28 near the border of Kharkiv. Subsequently, several media outlets captured the Russian Air Force of using the advanced fighter jet in the war. Earlier on Thursday, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down a Su-30 fighter over Irpin near Kyiv.

Notably, Russia initiated a full-fledged war against Ukraine nearly two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing the independence of breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin's action came despite West's repetitive warning and speculations about his ill-intention to invade Ukraine. Until then, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called his Russian counterpart to meet him, seeking a resolution to avert the war. However, on February 24, the Russian troops started a military operation against Ukraine, resulting in the heavy shelling and killing of more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians.

US sets up hotline with Russia to prevent any ‘miscalculation’

According to Ukraine’s emergency service, the ongoing conflict destroyed hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes. Amid the continuous Russian aggression against Ukraine, the United States has now initiated a fresh move to avert further ""escalation"" or ""miscalculation"". According to a report by The Guardian, the US has recently established a hotline with Russia’s ministry of defence with an aim to prevent any miscalculation by Moscow. The well-known “hotline” communication will enable the diplomats and other defence officials to share their critical views or demands related to the ongoing war.

Here is a primer on what it could do: The Sukhoi Su-34 is perhaps one of Russia’s most capable all-weather jet fighters, capable of ground, surface, and air attack. It’s seen service in Syria — and could be used to defend Russian interests in the Arctic.

Crew Cockpit

The Su-34 is a dual-engine, all-weather bomber/ground attack aircraft intended for use against naval and ground-based targets. It will allegedly replace both the Su-24 sweep-wing strike fighter and the Tu-22 bomber.

The Su-34 has a side-by-side arranged cockpit in which the pilot and copilot/navigator/weapons officer sit next to each other. Access to the cockpit is via a built-in stepladder that goes from behind the landing gear and into the rear of the cockpit.

According to the Sukhoi website, the cockpit is large and roomy enough to stand up inside. There is also apparently enough room for one of the two pilots to lie down — there’s even a toilet and a small galley inside.

The cockpit capsule is also armored against small arms and anti-aircraft fire with substantial titanium plating. Other aircraft components in the airframe are also armored.

In addition to 12 hardpoints on the wings and fuselage for a variety of bombs and missiles, the Su-34 has an internally-housed 30-millimeter cannon for ground attack.

A Very Unique Plane:

The Su-34 is an odd duck for a few reasons. In addition to it’s duckbill-shaped fuselage (the aircraft is apparently known within the Russian military as “Duckling” or “Duckbill”), the Su-34 combines the high payload and range of a medium- or long-distance bomber with the maneuverability of a fighter.

This is partly attributable to the Su-34 three-surface design. That is to say, in addition to wings and tail surfaces providing lift, there is also two canard lifting surfaces just rear of the cockpit that also provide additional lift and aid in maneuverability.

One of the Su-34’s more noticeable features is the distinctive tail boom on the rear of the fuselage. Accord to the company website, the boom houses a brake parachute, auxiliary power unit, additional fuel, and a smaller rear-facing radar antenna that can warn the pilots if missiles are incoming.

Arctic Bomber Umbrella

The Russian state-owned TASS media agency reported in 2015 that Russian Su-34s were being armed with air-to-air missiles following the fatal downing of a Su-24 by Turkish aircraft in which one pilot was killed.

In addition to fairly extensive Su-34 use in Syria as a bomber, the platform also seems to be playing a larger role in Russia’s Arctic ambitions. Recent construction on Russia’s arctic islands has led to speculation that Su-34 could be intended to beef up Russia’s Arctic defenses.

According to a recent risk assessment by Danish intelligence, Russian aircraft at some of Russia’s northernmost bases are “capable of reaching the airspace over northeastern Greenland with little prior warning,” including locations that house Su-34s.

This could threaten American and NATO interests in the region, the publication explained that “supported by air-to-air refueling, Russian combat aircraft could reach Thule Air Base, a key installation in the U.S. space and missile defense architecture, while simultaneously enlarging Russia’s A2/AD bubble into the North Atlantic.”

A Good Run for their Money

The facts are that the Su-34 has been combat tested in Syria. It’s a capable platform. Thanks to its large size and rear tail boom with extra fuel capacity, it has good range — and is very maneuverable.

Though it doesn’t have any stealthy characteristics, the Su-34 is nonetheless a capable platform, especially against other 4++ generation airframes. That means the Su-34 probably won’t go away anytime soon.

Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the site of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) had been shelled overnight and Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi immediately spoke with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal as well as the country’s national nuclear regulator and operator about the serious situation.
