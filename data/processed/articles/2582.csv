Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Thursday night that the Department of Energy had activated the Nuclear Incident Response team after Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant caught fire amid shelling by Russian troops.

“.@ENERGY has activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team and is monitoring events in consultation with @DeptofDefense, @NRCgov and the White House. We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility,” Granholm tweeted.

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Thursday that the nuclear power plant’s radiation levels and “essential” equipment were unaffected by the Russian shelling on the plant.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm called the Russian shelling “reckless.”

“I just spoke with Ukraine’s energy minister about the situation at the Zaphorizhizia nuclear plant. Russian military operations near the plant are reckless and must cease,” she tweeted.

White House knocks down talk of banning Russian oil imports

2:06 p.m.

The White House on Thursday knocked down talk of banning Russian oil imports, warning doing so could further spike the already high price of gas for Americans, after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) threw her support behind the idea.

“Our objective and the president’s objective has been to maximize impact on President Putin and Russia while minimizing impact to us and our allies and partners,” press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing with reporters.

“We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people around the world because it would reduce the supply available,” she continued. “And it’s as simple as less supply raises prices, and that is certainly a big factor for the president at this moment. It also has the potential to pad the pockets of President Putin, which is exactly what we are not trying to do.”

President Biden held a call on Thursday to discuss the conflict in Ukraine with the leaders of the Quad, an alliance made up of the United States, Australia, India and Japan.

Biden spoke with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida about the Russian invasion of Ukraine “and its broader implications.”

10:30 a.m.

The Biden administration is weighing whether to impose sanctions against India over its stockpile of and reliance on Russian military equipment as part of the wide-ranging consequences the West is seeking to impose on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

Donald Lu, the assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, on Thursday told lawmakers in a hearing that the administration is weighing how threatening India’s historically close military relationship with Russia is to U.S. security.

“It’s a question we’re looking at very closely, as the administration is looking at the broader question over whether to apply sanctions under CAATSA or to waive those sanctions,” Lu said, referring to the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

Lu told lawmakers that the administration is “in the process of trying to understand whether defense technology that we are sharing with India today can be adequately safeguarded given India’s historical relationship with Russia and its defense sales.”

“It is critical that with any partner, that the United States is able to assure itself that any defense technology we share is sufficiently protected,” he said.

The Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in literature and historically avoids making political statements, on Thursday condemned “in the strongest possible terms the Russian regime’s illegal invasion of Ukraine,” according to The Associated Press.

The organization said its history and mission “are deeply rooted in the traditions of freedom of expression, freedom of belief and freedom of inquiry.”

“We therefore join the legion of our fellow academies, literary and cultural institutions, places of higher learning, defenders of a free press, human rights organizations and nation states in expressing our abhorrence of the Russian government’s unjustified attack on Ukraine and its people,” it said.

Zelensky says Ukrainian defenses holding

10:04 a.m.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that the country’s defense lines were holding against the Russian incursions and referred to the attack as “another virus” the country had to face.

“It’s been a week now that another virus attacked” and Ukrainians “have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” he said in an emotional speech, according to Reuters.

Zelensky told Ukrainians that the defense forces had held their lines against Russia’s invasion through another night filled with airstrikes.

“They wanted to destroy us so many times. They couldn’t. We’ve been through so much! And if someone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken or surrender — he knows nothing about Ukraine, and he has nothing to do in Ukraine,” he said in a video message according to CBS News.

The president said that Ukrainians have endured tragedies and hardship including two world wars, the Holodomor famine, Holocaust, Soviet terror, the Chernobyl nuclear explosion and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

“We don’t have the biggest territory … we don’t have nuclear arms, we don’t provide oil and gas to international markets. But we do have our people. We do have our land. This is what we are fighting for,” he said, according to Reuters.

“We urge people to begin providing total popular resistance to the enemy in the occupied territories,” Arestovich said, according to The Associated Press.

“The weak side of the Russian army is the rear — if we burn them now and block the rear, the war will stop in a matter of days,” he added.

“Total resistance … this is our Ukrainian trump card and this is what we can do best in the world,” the presidential aide also said, encouraging people to build barricades in the city, rally, create online networks and defend the country to the best of their ability.

Russia suspends rocket engine deliveries to US

9:15 a.m.

Russian officials have suspended deliveries of rocket engines to the U.S. in retaliation for the sanctions placed on them over the invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

State-space agency Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin told state media Thursday that his agency will stop servicing rocket engines it has previously delivered to the U.S.

Rogozin said the U.S. still has 24 engines that will be left without Russian technical assistance, according to Reuters.

“In a situation like this, we can’t supply the United States with our world’s best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don’t know what,” Rogozin told state media.

Rogozin said Russia has delivered a total of 122 RD-180 engines to the U.S. in the 1990s, of which 98 were used to power Atlas launch vehicles.
