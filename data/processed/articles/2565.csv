The mayor of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevych, said in an interview on Thursday that Russian forces that had captured the southern city of Kherson on Wednesday were headed northwest toward his city. The distance is about 36 miles.

Roughly 800 Russian vehicles, including a column of rocket launchers, were advancing on Mykolaiv from the north, east and south. Mr. Senkevych said that there had been no shelling inside the city, but that Ukrainian forces dug in along the city’s perimeter had been fired on by long-range rockets, forcing them to constantly retrench.

“The city is ready for war,” Mr. Senkevych said.

Russia is seeking to enable separatist forces it supports in Crimea, the southern peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, to connect by land with forces it supports in Ukraine’s east, said Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine Forum group at Chatham House, a policy institute in London. She said Russia’s invading units are thus also attacking the port city of Mariupol.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/world/europe/russia-ukraine-mykolaiv-black-sea.html

Mykolaiv, where Ukrainian officials say they repelled a Russian attack, is seen as the next key stepping stone for Russian forces on the road to Odesa, which came under naval shell fire on Friday, after taking the key southern city of Kherson earlier this week.

The latest fighting came as local authorities in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv raised the death toll from an airstrike that hit streets and residential buildings to forty-seven people.

“On 3 March, 47 people were killed by a Russian airstrike on a residential area in Chernihiv,” local authorities said on Facebook.

As battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued on Friday across the country, including north-west of the capital, Kyiv, and the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka.

Loud explosions could be heard in Kyiv throughout Friday, where thick plumes of black smoke towered over the capital’s north-western outskirts. A Russian airstrike on a rural residential about 6 miles from Kyiv’s outskirts killed at least seven people on Friday, including two children.

“I don’t know what the tanks are doing because they can’t cross the river into Kyiv,” local security guard Vasyl Prikhodko said.

“They are shooting at things. Then they are rolling back. Maybe they are just trying to scare us,” the 47-year-old said.

On Friday, church bells and air raid sirens rang out across the deserted central streets of Kyiv, with the only signs of life queues outside pharmacies. The city continues to empty out as more and more people flee before the Russian assault intensifies.

With shocking images on television from Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, Kyiv residents have decided not to wait for the same carnage to come to them.

Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, claimed this week that Ukrainian officials had foiled three assassination plots against president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

However, Yevgeny Ptashnik, commander of the territorial defence unit guarding the government quarter in central Kyiv, said he doubted the plots were real. “For Putin it’s very important to take our president alive,” he claimed, citing Putin’s shock at the execution of Muammar Gaddafi.

He commended Zelenskiy’s bravery for staying in central Kyiv rather than fleeing to a bunker somewhere in the west of the country. “This is the difference between us and others. We don’t hide, we stay strong until the end,” he said.

As the war has taken an ever more horrific turn almost by the day, eyewitness reported dead lying in the streets of Volnovakha near Donetsk.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said Ukrainian forces had prevented Russian efforts to take Mykolaiv while artillery defended Odesa from repeated attempts by Russian ships to fire on the major Black Sea port.

In a sign of the mounting pressure on Ukrainian forces, not least in the south, who are under siege in cities across the country, the flagship of the country’s naval fleet – the Hetman Sahaidachny – was scuttled at the shipyard in Mykolaiv where it was undergoing repairs, to prevent it from being seized by Russian forces.

Another strategic port, Mariupol on the Azov Sea, was “partially under siege,” said officials with Ukrainian forces were pushing back efforts to surround the city where civilians described increasingly desperate conditions.

The battles have knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said.

With the conflict in Ukraine, which was triggered by Russia’s invasion last week, seeing spiralling violence amid accusations of potential Russian war crimes in their assault on Ukrainian cities.

In a further sign of the widening scope of the conflict, Ukraine’s state emergency agency issued mass text messages Friday with advice on what to do in case of an explosion.

Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites and making significant gains in the south, including taking the port of Kherson, the first major city to fall.

The Russian campaign, which has seen civilian centres threatened with devastation, has so far been most successful in the south where the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of the Crimean Peninsula has given it logistical advantage in the country’s south.

With 1.2 million people already displaced, long queues of cars were heading to the Moldova border, most from Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia.

Severing Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014.

As the war has driven ever larger numbers to flee the country, many fleeing had to walking long distances.

Walking the final 14 miles to Ukraine’s border and to safety, Ludmila Sokol was moved by the mounds of clothes and other personal effects that many people discarded as they fled the fighting before her.

Vladimir Putin's forces have made further gains in Ukraine, seizing control of a nuclear power plant and reducing cities to rubble as Volodymyr Zelensky desperately battles to save his country from the invading forces on the ninth day of fighting.

Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday, with CCTV capturing a fierce gun battle that sparked a fire in a six-storey training building just outside the main complex.

Warships are still poised off the coast of Odessa, while the port city of Mykolaiv, near Kherson which was the first city claimed by Russia, is feared to be the next under Putin's control.

Kyiv continues to face intense shelling but has so far been spared a major assault, with Russia's main attack force stalled for days in a miles-long convoy on a highway to the north.

But there are growing concerns that the stationary troops are regrouping and amassing logistical supplies before launching a fierce onslaught on the capital.

Putin want to 'sever' Ukraine in half and deprive the north of resources needed to keep fighting the war - a siege tactic reminiscent of how he won the Chechen war in 2000.

Just over a week after Putin launched his savage campaign, MailOnline assesses the gains being made by the Russians in the cities where they are meeting fierce resilience from Ukraine.

Kyiv

Moscow's advance on Ukraine's capital may have stalled but the city is still being subjected to heavy bombardment from the air.

Loud explosions could be heard this morning and an air raid siren constantly blared.

Blasts also rocked the city yesterday and Hostomel Airport has seen intense fighting, with the transport hub changing hands multiple times in recent days.

Russian tanks and armoured vehicles are yet to enter the city, with the huge convoy still stuck around 16 miles from Kyiv.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with comical mishaps including fuel and food shortages.

But there are also some concerns that the 15,000 troops attached to the convoy may be regrouping and waiting for supplies before launching a blistering assault on Kyiv.

Russia made clear its plans to quickly seize the capital, with Western security officials fearing they would overthrow the government and implement their new regime within days.

But stiffer than expected resistance from the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians has staved off the swift victory that Russia may have expected.

An aide to Zelensky has called on soldier and volunteers to use guerrilla tactics against Russian forces, to cut down trees and destroy rear columns of Russian troops.

Zaporizhzhia

Putin's troops attacked the continent's largest nuclear power plant overnight, sparking a fire that raged for hours before emergency crews were eventually allowed to extinguish it as Russian soldiers seized the complex.

Russian troops had attacked the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday, with CCTV capturing a fierce gun battle between Putin's men and Ukrainian defenders that sparked a fire in a six-storey training building just outside the main complex.

Moscow's men then stopped firefighters getting to the building for several hours.

Eventually, emergency crews were allowed to go in and douse the flames before Russian troops moved in an occupied the site, which provides a fifth of Ukraine's electricity.

Fire-damaged buildings at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear complex are pictured on Friday morning after coming under attack by Russian forces overnight, leading to international condemnation

The UN's nuclear monitoring agency said that, fortunately, none of the site's six reactors had been directly damaged and radiation levels remained normal. Three Ukrainian troops were killed defending the complex, Kyiv said.

Moscow has, predictably, attempted to deny responsibility for the attack, saying its forces had come under attack by Ukrainian 'saboteurs' while patrolling the plant, who then set fire to the building themselves.

Ukraine is home to three other active nuclear power plants, one of which is located 70 miles from the city of Mykolaiv which Russian forces have begun attacking after seizing nearby Kherson. The other two active sites are located in the west and are not currently under threat, though that situation could change as the Russian attack branches out. Ukraine also has five sites which are out of action, including Chernobyl, but could still pose a risk if hit by shells.

President Zelensky said the attack on Zaporizhzhia could have caused a crisis equivalent to 'six Chernobyls' - referencing the fact that the modern-day plant has six reactors while the Soviet-era disaster affected only one - and called on Russians to end the fighting.

Russian armoured vehicles and troops attacked the nuclear power plant in the early hours of Friday, shooting and shelling guards holed up in administrative buildings near the nuclear reactors - setting one of them on fire

Zaporizhzhia has six nuclear reactors, making it the largest of its kind in Europe, and accounts for about one quarter of Ukraine's power generation. One report said the fire was about 150 meters away from one of the reactors

Nuclear experts told the BBC that attacks on Zaporizhzhia were 'frightening' but that any disaster caused by fighting would be similar to Fukushima in 2011 rather than Chernobyl in 1986. Fukushima, in Japan, melted down after a tsunami cut electricity to the plant, disabling its cooling system. Chernobyl exploded after a training exercise gone-wrong caused an uncontrolled nuclear reaction.

Claire Corkhill, professor of nuclear materials at Sheffield University, told the corporation that the reactors at Zaporizhzhia now appear to be shutting down to remove the danger - which may have been Russia's intention in attacking the plant.

Mykolaiv

Fears are growing that Mykolaiv will soon be the biggest city to fall to Russia.

The mayor said Russian troops had entered his city of around 500,000 people and there was now fighting inside it.

Local authorities in the shipbuilding city told residents not to panic and Zelenskiy's military adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the Russian advance there had been halted.

'We can feel cautious optimism about the future prospects of the enemy offensive - I think that it will be stopped in other areas also,' he said

The US believes Russia's goal may be to move past Kherson to Mykolaiv in order to set up a base of operations there that they can then use in a move to encircle and take Odesa.

In a video statement shared online, Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said fighting was under way in parts of the city. 'Let's not get nervous,' he said.

Kherson

Kherson remains the only city to be captured by Russian forces in a huge strategic win for Putin.

The city allows his troops to cross the Dnieper River and advance on Kyiv from the south, with army commanders able to link up the two main offensives.

The city also holds the fresh water supply for the region, meaning Russia could use it in Crimea.

Mayor Igor Kolykhaevr said 'armed visitors' joined a local council meeting and imposed a curfew. He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets.

The mayor said Russian troops had entered his city of around 500,000 people and there was now fighting inside it.

'We don't have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE,' he said in a statement.

The mayor said Kherson would maintain a strict 8pm to 6am curfew and restrict traffic into the city to food and medicine deliveries.

The city will also require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to 'provoke the troops.'

Cutting Ukraine's access to the coastline would deal a crippling blow to the country's economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor stretching from its border, across Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and all the way west to Romania.

Mariupol

Perhaps the hardest-hit has been the city of Mariupol, on Ukraine's eastern Black Sea coast, with the fire kept up near-continuously into today with the city completely surrounded.

The heavy Russian shelling of Mariupol has been compared to the Nazi Siege of Leningrad in World War Two which lasted for three years and practically levelled the entire city.

An incessant attack of artillery, rockets and airstrikes has obliterated the city and killed hundreds.

Capturing the city would allow Russia to link Donetsk and Luhansk with Crimea which was annexed in 2014.

Local officials say the city is without water, heat, or electricity, and bombardment is so heavy that medics cannot clear the dead from the streets.

'They are trying to create a blockade here, just like in Leningrad,' Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said, referring to the brutal Nazi siege of Russia's second city, now re-named Saint Petersburg.

Kharkiv

In the northeast, along another major axis of the Russian attack, the city of Kharkiv has been under bombardment since the start of the invasion which worsened sharply this week, but defenders are holding out.

Dozens have been killed and hundreds injured in the city which has been reduced to rubble with many residential buildings destroyed.

The city remains under Ukrainian control but Russian paratroopers landed on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday and raided a military hospital.

If Russia seizes the city, it will be able to launch an offensive on Kyiv from another front.

Meanwhile the central Freedom Square was attacked on Wednesday, which Zelensky labelled 'frank, undisguised terror. Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime.'

It wasn't immediately clear what type of weapon was used or how many people were killed, but Zelensky said there were dozens of casualties.

It was the first time the Russian military had hit the center of the city of 1.5 million people whose residential neighborhoods have been under shelling fire for days.

Izyum, a city 70 miles to the south of Kharkiv towards Donetsk, has also came under heavy bombardment with explosions lighting up the night sky.

Despite the incessant shelling and bombardment, Kharkiv remains in Ukrainian hands.

Chernihiv

Chernihiv, to the north east of Kyiv, and Kharkiv, in Ukraine's east, were braced for more heavy shelling today after days of increasingly indiscriminate attacks including with banned cluster munitions have left dozens of civilians dead.

Located to the north-west of Kyiv, the city has been the site of fierce fighting with Russian troops since the early days of the invasion but is still under Ukraine's control.

Yesterday, at least 47 people were killed after Russian forces hit residential areas, including schools and a high-rise apartment block, with the banned cluster bombs according to local officials.

Rescue work had to be suspended due to the heavy shelling.

Odessa

The Black Sea port city, and Ukraine's main naval base, is preparing for a Russian assault after a dozen warships were seen forming up near Crimea.

Defences are being built with fears that Putin wants to choke the economy by seizing the port through which grain and minerals are exported to Europe.

The mayor said fighter jets appear to be testing air defences by flying sorties overhead, as residents prepare makeshift defences made of old railway sleepers and lay landmines on the beach.

There have also been reports of Russian rocket or artillery fire at the city's airport, Ukraine's deputy defence minister said.

But an official said despite bracing for an attack, there has been no major Russian military moves on the port city.

Meanwhile, an Estonian-owned cargo ship was sunk off the coast of Ukraine after hitting a mine yesterday.

Four crew members are still missing and two are in a life raft at sea following the explosion near Odessa.

Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, said the ship likely struck a mine, adding: 'The vessel has finally sunk. Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don't know where they are at the moment.'

Estonia is a member of NATO and the EU, and while an official reason has yet to be given for the blast, the possibility that it was the result of a mine risks further destabilising an already explosive situation in Eastern Europe.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - The United States believes that Russian forces have not yet taken over the Ukrainian city of Kherson, but could use it as part of a strategy for potentially moving to Mykolaiv and then onto Odessa, a senior U.S. defense official said on Thursday.

Tanks entered the port town of Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday. read more

""There's still fighting there, so we're not ready to call it one way or another,"" the U.S. official told reporters, adding that the situation on the ground was changing quickly.

If Kherson were to be captured, it would be the first significant urban center to fall into the hands of Russian troops.

""What they may want to do is move on (Mykolaiv) so that they can then position themselves to the northeast of Odessa in case, in fact, they want to move on Odessa, not just from the sea, but from the ground,"" said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

The invasion, which started eight days ago, has not seen Russian aircraft control Ukraine's airspace. Russian troops are still stalled about 25 km (16 miles) outside Kyiv's city center.

The official said that Russia had moved about 90% of its pre-staged combat power into Ukraine so far and about 480 missiles had been fired by Russian forces at Ukrainian targets.

U.S. intelligence satellite imagery had been impacted by poor weather over Ukraine, the official said. On Monday, publicly available satellite images showed a Russian military convoy north of Kyiv stretching for about 64 km (40 miles).

A majority of Russian missile launches had come from inside of Ukraine as Russia moved in mobile systems, the official said, adding that the United States could still not confirm the presence or use of thermobaric weapons in Ukraine.

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace earlier on Thursday said Putin had deployed thermobaric weapons systems in Ukraine. read more

The U.S. official said: ""We know that they have the launching systems available to them in Ukraine that could be used for rockets that have a thermobaric warhead on them. But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use.""
