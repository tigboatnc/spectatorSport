Mr Obama was making his first public speech at the executive mansion since he left office. He participated in a celebration of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, as Mr Biden announced changes to the healthcare programme that could see as many as 200,000 uninsured Americans become eligible for new coverage.

The visit has many Democrats hoping that Mr Biden can benefit from his former boss’s still-high approval rating among the Democratic base. Mr Biden has lately struggled to raise his poor standing in the polls and there are serious worries that apathy and disappointment among Democratic voters could give an opening to Republicans in this year’s midterm elections. Mr Obama says that to win in the midterms, Democrats have a story to tell, they “just got to tell it.”

ICYMI: Biden extends student loan freeze a sixth time

15:44 , Andrew Naughtie

As Joe Biden remains under pressure from his party to cancel as much federal student loan debt as possible, his administration has once again pushed back the deadline for the resumption of payments frozen during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the sixth time the deadline’s been moved, and will give debtors until at least 31 August.

Mr Biden has previously said he supports cancelling the debt altogether through congressional action, but his critics on the left say he has the power to do so unilaterally via executive action.

ICYMI: Cruz bizarrely blames Biden for Ukraine war

15:20 , Andrew Naughtie

The Republican line on Ukraine, Russia and Vladimir Putin is still somewhat unclear, but the party’s more pugilistic members are sticking to one predictable version of events: blaming the unilateral Russian attack on an American ally on Joe Biden.

Ted Cruz took that line this week on Fox News, telling Sean Hannity that Mr Biden “caused this war” by waiving sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline – which in fact never became operational.

Dire economic warning from major bank

13:51 , Andrew Naughtie

Deutsche Bank has issued a stark forecast for the near future of the US economy, predicting that the country will fall into recession next year. Stocks will fall 20 per cent by next summer, says the bank, and unemployment – currently at a remarkable low – will rise by more than a percentage point in the next two years.

Coming from a bank, these specific predictions are unlikely to cut through the news cycle to everyday Americans, but the electorate’s attitude to the economy is hardly optimistic as things stand.

Long Covid has affected many people previously able to work to the point where they effectively have a new disability, meaning they may be entitled to new rights of which they’re unaware.

Will Obama and Biden’s bromance do anything for the Democrats?

10:01 , Andrew Naughtie

The Independent’s Holly Baxter takes a look at yesterday’s White House appearance by Barack Obama, writing that it at least provided some welcome emotional warmth at a deeply negative moment...

there is something genuinely touching about the friendship. When Obama surprised Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017 and Biden became overwhelmed with emotion, it would’ve taken a heart of stone not to be moved. Biden is the kind of man for whom America and its pageantry really does mean everything, a man who spent most of his life shuttling between Scranton, Delaware and DC. Obama gave him the best gift he could ever have received — until the country did one better and voted him president, of course. Yet Obama was mostly silent during Biden’s presidential run, endorsing him late and staying out of the conversation when he was busy debating fellow Democrats. The world was hungry for more from the old bromance, back when politics felt a little simpler. And this week, Uncle Joe and Barack did some fan service.

At the same time, though, she ponders whether the visit can really offer much to Democrats as the president struggles around the 40 per cent approval mark and his agenda faces ongoing obstruction in Congress.

Read her take below.

Obama is doing bromance fan service with Biden. But is it enough?

Analysis: the worst of the KBJ hearings

09:25 , Andrew Naughtie

As the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson draws near, Andrew Feinberg has this look back on the depths that were plumbed at her hearings by the Judiciary Committee’s Republican contingent and their colleagues on the Senate floor.

“Republican senators,” he writes, “spent the majority of their speaking time in both settings airing grievances regarding Democrats’ treatment of prior nominees going back to the Senate’s rejection of Judge Robert Bork more than three decades ago. They also subjected Jackson, a Harvard Law School graduate who has thrice been confirmed by the upper chamber (twice to court seats and once to a seat on the US Sentencing Commission), to some of the most bizarre inquiries ever directed at a nominee for the highest court in the land.”

Illinois Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger criticised members of his party on Tuesday for what he sees as their unwillingness to speak out against the crisis in Ukraine.

“The world order is being challenged for the first time since World War II and they’re sitting around thinking today about how we can win our next election, what the newest outrage is, what’s the next thing we can do to get people angry and upset and get their money from them for our reelection,” he added.

Homeland security secretary takes a meeting with Republican caucus over border restrictions

Homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday had a meeting with House GOP members of the “border security caucus” but the Republicans were “not satisfied with the answers.”

The Border Security Caucus — after last week’s announcement that the White House would lift all Trump-era Covid restrictions at the border — was fully charged during the meeting.

“It was a rough crowd, and you got to give him a lot of credit for picking the roughest crowd, going in, and listening to them,” Darrell Issa, a California Republican who attended the meeting said.

“Nothing was really resolved, other than he made a promise to give a number of follow-up pieces of information,” he said.

Representative Brian Babin of Texas, the co-chairman of the caucus said of the meeting: “We appreciated his courage to come in, knowing that we were opposed to him 100 per cent. But we were not satisfied with the answers he gave us.”

Biden to extend Covid student loan freeze until 31 August

The US is once again extending its pandemic-era pause on federal student loan repayments, pushing back the restart date until at least 31 August, the Associated Press reports.

This marks the sixth time the deadline to resume payments has been extended, as Joe Biden faces pressure from Congress and inflation worries.

Prior to the extension, the moratorium was set to expire on 1 May, and more than 43 million Americans with a collective $1.6 trillion in government loans were going to be on the hook again for their debt.

Mr Austin was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to testify at a House Armed Services Committee hearing regarding the Defence Department’s fiscal year 2023 budget request, but Mr Gaetz had apparently decided to use his time to berate the former US Central Command boss about what he described as US defence failures caused by the Pentagon’s embrace of “wokeness”.

Specifically, Mr Gaetz enquired about a lecture delivered at the US National Defence University by French economist and author Thomas Picketty entitled “Responding to China: The Case For Global Justice and Democratic Socialism”.
