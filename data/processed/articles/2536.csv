During an attack early Friday on the southeastern city of Enerhodar, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power complex, a fire broke out in one of the six reactors. Hours later, authorities reported that the blaze had been extinguished, radiation levels remained normal and the complex was in the hands of Russian forces — whom Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had beseeched to stop targeting the plant, for fear of a nuclear nightmare.

“Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,” Zelensky said in an emotional video speech. “Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”

Ukraine’s nuclear regulator said the agency’s staff was inspecting the compartment of Reactor No. 1 at the Zaporizhzhia plant for damage. The agency said on Facebook it was important that the plant maintain the capacity to cool nuclear fuel in order to avoid a disastrous meltdown.

International nuclear authorities expressed concern but not panic even as the fire triggered phone calls between Zelensky and President Biden and other world leaders.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine shuddered into a second week, the full extent of a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II was coming into focus. An estimated 1 million Ukrainians — half of them children — have sought refuge outside the country, the United Nations and humanitarian organizations report.

The total number of those displaced internally and externally could swell to a staggering 10 million, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

Despite a tentative agreement Thursday by Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to set up safe corridors in some locales to allow humanitarian aid in and civilians out, the ferocity of the fighting has been escalating daily.

Russian forces unleashed a fresh barrage of artillery fire, rockets and air attacks Thursday on Mariupol, a strategic city of about 430,000 people in southeastern Ukraine, on the Sea of Azov near the Russian border, news reports said. Hundreds were feared dead in attacks that crumbled buildings and left civilians cowering in terror.

“We cannot count the number of victims there, but we believe at least hundreds of people are dead,” Mariupol’s deputy mayor, Serhiy Orlov, told the BBC. “We cannot go in to retrieve the bodies. My father lives there. I cannot reach him. I don’t know if he is alive or dead.”

The start of the onslaught against Mariupol coincided with Russia’s capture Wednesday of Kherson, at the mouth of the Dnieper near the Black Sea, which became the first major city to fall and indicated Russia’s intensifying attacks on civilians.

Invading troops have begun moving west from Kherson toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center, and amphibious landing vessels were reported to be heading toward the historic seaside city of Odessa.

A spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which supplies about a quarter of the country’s power, told Ukrainian television that firefighters could not reach the complex because Russian troops were shooting at them.

He said that the fire was in a reactor that is under renovation and not operating, but that it contains nuclear fuel.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!”

The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter that Ukrainian regulators had reported normal radiation levels around the plant.

The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

The Russian advances in the south came as Russian and Ukrainian representatives agreed on a mechanism for establishing humanitarian corridors, which would be coupled with temporary local cease-fires.

But few are holding out hope that the negotiations will be able to halt the biggest ground war in Europe in more than 75 years. Putin demands that Ukraine demilitarize and declare neutrality, and more broadly, the Russian leader has made clear his wish to reestablish Russia’s sphere of influence across the former Eastern Bloc, rearranging Europe’s entire security architecture.

Some of those who have been in direct contact with Putin paint a dire picture of the Russian leader’s possible intentions in Ukraine.

After a 90-minute phone call Thursday between French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin, a senior French official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity offered a bleak assessment: “Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come.”

Western allies continued to try to force Putin from his course with new punitive steps. The White House said Thursday that the U.S. would impose sanctions reaching into Putin’s inner circle, targeting eight members of Russia’s elite, including Putin’s official spokesman. The Biden administration will also place visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and their family members.

Although Ukrainians have put up staunch resistance over eight days of fighting, reports on the ground were grim. Russian troops have now surrounded Mariupol on all sides and could capture the port at any time, Ukrainian officials acknowledged.

“Our internal forces are very brave, but we are surrounded by the Russian army,” Orlov, the deputy mayor, told CNN. In Washington, a senior Defense official told reporters that the Pentagon believes that 90% of the forces that Putin assembled for the invasion are now in Ukraine.

The capture of Mariupol would bridge the gap between territories held by Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and Russian soldiers in the southern peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow annexed by force in 2014.

Along with the seizure of other coastal cities, it would give Russia control over the rest of southern Ukraine, cutting off the country’s access to key shipping routes in the Black Sea and devastating Ukraine economically.

The desperate conditions in Mariupol and elsewhere paint a dire picture for Ukraine of an overwhelmingly powerful military foe willing to launch more attacks on civilian targets, including schools and hospitals. A prosecutor for the International Criminal Court says senior Russian leaders are being investigated for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.

Cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv have come under devastating fire as the Russian military attempts to regain the initiative after its initial assault failed to achieve a rapid victory. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in the invasion.

Kyiv was hit by two massive explosions that lighted up the sky Wednesday evening and before dawn Thursday. One of the blasts damaged the central train station, a key transit point for thousands fleeing the capital, but packed trains were still running on Thursday, ferrying people away from danger.

But while the capital remains under heavy threat, a 40-mile-long column of Russian armored vehicles on Kyiv’s northern outskirts “is still stuck there,” U.S. and British defense officials said Thursday, amid intelligence that the convoy was experiencing fuel and supply shortages, together with sporadic attacks by Ukrainian regular and irregular forces.

Putin insisted that Russian forces were not targeting civilians. “Precision weapons are used to destroy exclusively military infrastructure,” he said, describing any reports otherwise as “elements of an anti-Russian disinformation campaign.”

The Ukrainian president continued to voice defiance.

“One week ago, at 4 a.m., Russia invaded our independent Ukraine, our land,” Zelensky said Thursday in the latest video address aimed at buoying his people and showing them he remains in place and in charge. “The first hours and days ... were extremely difficult, but we were united and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood.”

Western governments, meanwhile, sought to bolster front-line states on Russia’s western flank.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was visiting Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia “to underscore our solidarity and determination to hold the Russian and Belarusian governments accountable for their brutal war against Ukraine,” he said in a departure statement Thursday.

British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, also visiting vulnerable Baltic states, did not mince words about what might lie ahead.

“What we’ve seen in Ukraine is beyond … anybody’s idea of what might happen,” Wallace said at a news conference in Estonia. “Not only has Russia illegally invaded Ukraine, it is now unleashing violence on civilian areas, bombardments and inflicting casualties on potentially thousands of civilians.”

But Wallace said most major population centers remain under the Ukrainian flag.

“They still have not taken control of a number of the big cities,” he said of Russian troops. “They might have entered them; in some cases, they’ve been repelled. But taking control of large cities is a completely different step, and they have not succeeded.”

In the face of international condemnation, including a U.N. General Assembly resolution Wednesday demanding a halt to Moscow’s aggression, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted Thursday that the U.S. and its NATO allies were responsible for provoking the war.

“They are listening to us, but they are not hearing us, and they’re trying to force upon us their own understanding of how Europe should live,” Lavrov said, comparing the U.S. to Napoleon and Hitler in its “goal to subjugate Europe.”

Russia is paying an increasing economic price for its war. The country’s central bank said the main stock exchange would remain closed for the fourth consecutive day Thursday, a move made to prevent a collapse of the Moscow Exchange.

Russian forces have continued to bombard the besieged city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, officials said, as Russia presses its offensive on multiple fronts a week into its invasion of Ukraine.

Russian troops continued to lay siege to the strategic port city on Thursday, cutting it off electricity, food, water, heating and transport, its mayor said.

Vadym Boychenko said Mariupol has been encircled and under constant attack over the previous 24 hours.

“They are trying to create a blockade here, just like in Leningrad,” he said in a statement referring to the siege of Russia’s second-largest city by the Nazis during World War II, which left hundreds of thousands dead.

“They are trying to prevent us from repairing electricity, water and heating supply,” Boychenko said, adding that Russian troops also damaged the rail link “so that we could not evacuate our women, children and elderly people.”

The Mariupol city council said Russia was constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure and preventing bringing supplies or evacuating people.

Electricity and phone connections were largely down, making it difficult for medics to know where to take the wounded. Homes and shops were facing food and water shortages.

“We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said.

The city of more than 400,000 people is a key target for Russian forces. It is Ukraine’s strategic port on the Sea of Azov and is also close to territories controlled by Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region.

Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, said the situation in Mariupol was “extraordinary”.

“There is no food, no water, no fuel and very little hope for people [there]. Some were getting out at the last minute as convoys with tanks came the other way. But there are awful scenes from the city and the pressure on local hospitals is intense. There has been just no sparing of anything in the way the city has been shelled,” Simmons said.

As the full-scale invasion of Ukraine entered its second week, Russia was still pressing its offensive on a variety of fronts even as it took part in a second round of talks with Ukrainian officials at an undisclosed location.

Moscow’s advance on Ukraine’s southern front is seen as strategically important as it could cut the country off the sea and provide a link between Russian-controlled Crimea and breakaway Donbas republics.

Pro-Russian separatists said they had “tightened their circle” around Mariupol. Igor Konashenkov, chief spokesman for Russia’s Ministry of Defence, claimed the forces had gained control of three more communities in the area surrounding Mariupol, according to Russian news agencies.

On Wednesday, the Russian military said it had seized Kherson, a Black Sea shipbuilding city of 290,000 people, after a three-day siege that left it short of food and medicine. Ukrainian authorities rejected Russia’s claim.

Kherson, strategically located in southern Ukraine at the mouth of the Dneiper River’s exit into the Black Sea, is the first significant urban centre to fall since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Taking control of the city is a significant victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin after a string of military setbacks.

More than six weeks after the Russian siege began, Ukrainian troops are continuing to fight the vastly superior Russian forces in ferocious battles amid the ruins of what once was a bustling city on the Sea of Azov coast.

WATCH: Russian forces enter Mariupol as outgunned Ukrainians prepare for renewed assault

The city’s mayor says that an estimated 120,000 people remain in the city, of Mariupol’s pre-war population of about 450,000.

The Ukrainians’ fight against all odds has scuttled Moscow’s designs, tying up significant Russian forces and delaying the start of a planned Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine’s industrial heartland, Donbas. The Kremlin hopes that an attack in the east could reverse the battlefield fortunes for Russia after a humiliating failure of its attempt to quickly storm the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

Mariupol has been a key objective for Russia since the start of its invasion on Feb. 24. Capturing the city would allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014 and deprive Ukraine of a major port and prized industrial assets.

The giant Azovstal steel mill and other industrial plants have been heavily damaged by the ferocious Russian bombardment that has flattened much of Mariupol, indiscriminately hitting homes, hospitals and other public buildings and killing thousands.

The victims include about 300 people killed in last month’s Russian airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theater that was being used as a shelter and had the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the pavement outside to ward off aerial attack.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told The Associated Press that at least 21,000 people were killed in Mariupol with bodies “carpeted through the streets.” He said that the Russians deployed mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to methodically dispose of the victims’ bodies in order to hide the evidence of the massacre and prevent international organizations from documenting “the horror the Russian army is responsible for.”

The discovery of hundreds of bodies of civilians apparently executed by Russian forces in Kyiv’s suburbs after the Russian retreat from the area has fueled global outrage and accusations from Ukrainians and the West that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.

Moscow has deployed fighters from Chechnya, known for their ferocity, to wage street battles in Mariupol. Chechnya’s Moscow-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has repeatedly boasted on his messaging app channel about defeating Ukrainians in Mariupol, but the fight has continued.

Boychenko said that several Ukrainian units are still fighting the Russians in Mariupol, including the 36th Marine Brigade, the Azov Regiment, some Interior Ministry troops and border guards.

The Azov Regiment, a seasoned volunteer force that is widely considered one of the country’s most capable units, is defending the mammoth Azovstal steel plant that covers an area of nearly 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles). It has taken advantage of the plant’s sprawling network of concrete buildings and underground facilities to repel continuous Russian attacks.

The 36th Marine Brigade was maintaining defensive positions at the Azovmash and Zavod Ilyicha factories until it ran out of supplies and ammunition and made a desperate attempt to break through the Russian blockade earlier this week.

In a post on the brigade’s Facebook page, one of its officers described the unit’s heroic resistance, saying that “for more than a month, the marines have been fighting without replenishing amunition, food and water supplies.” “The wounded accounted for nearly a half of the brigade’s strength, but those who still had their limbs and were capable of walking reported back to duty,” the post said.

Boychenko said that some of the marines managed to join the Azov regiment, while others were captured by the Russians. He didn’t give any numbers.

The Russian military said Thursday that a total of 1,160 Ukrainian marines surrendered this week, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified.

As the Ukrainian troops continue to offer fierce resistance in Mariupol, fears have grown that the exasperated Russians could resort to chemical weapons to deal with the remaining pockets of resistance at the Azovstal plant and other areas of the city.

Eduard Basurin, a Russia-allied separatist official in eastern Ukraine, appeared to call for that Monday, telling Russian state TV that the Russia-backed forces should block all the exits out of the factory and then “use chemical troops to smoke them out of there.” He later said that no chemical weapons were used.

WATCH: What the Biden administration learned from past presidents about military aid in Ukraine

The Azov Regiment claimed Monday, without providing evidence, that a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on its positions but inflicted no serious injuries. A Ukrainian defense official said the attack possibly involved phosphorus munitions.

Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russians have blocked humanitarian convoys from reaching Mariupol, keeping it without food, water and power since the siege started. The Russian troops have turned back buses sent to evacuate residents, but about 150,000 have been able to flee the city in their own vehicles.

Boychenko said that at least 33,500, and, possibly, up to 50,000 Mariupol residents have been taken to “filtration camps” in the separatist-controlled east before being forcibly sent to distant, economically depressed areas in Russia.

Mariupol has seen communications cut since the start of the siege, and as the Russians moved to capture sections of the city they launched radio broadcasts to brainwash the population.

“They unleashed propaganda, telling people that Kyiv and other cities have been captured and they have been abandoned,” Boychenko said.

The continuing fighting in Mariupol has forced the Russian military to keep a significant number of troops in the city, delaying the start of the planned new offensive in eastern Ukraine.

“As long as the street fighting is going on, Russia can’t remove troops from Mariupol and deploy them to other areas, including Donbas,” Oleh Zhdanov, an independent military expert, told the AP.

“The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol are still fulfilling their main task by diverting the Russian forces from other areas. Mariupol remains a major symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.”",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mariupol-holds-out-against-russias-siege-a-symbol-of-ukrainian-resistance

Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

Scenes from the city of Mariupol, under heavy attack in Ukraine’s southeast, have been as grim as they get. No water. No electricity. No heat. Officials in the encircled city say they can’t offer an accurate estimate of fatalities because no one has been able to leave the relative safety of wherever they’ve taken shelter to go out and find the dead.

Mariupol, a heavily fortified city of 430,000, may be a dismal harbinger of things to come for other Ukrainian cities, as Russian forces — unable to capture the country quickly — carry out siege tactics and mass shelling to take over major metropolitan areas.

A senior Western intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity, warned this week to brace for “massive loss of human life, especially civilians,” in the coming days and weeks as the war in Ukraine enters a new stage.

“These will be real sieges,” the official said. “They will be almost medieval in their approach. They will cordon cities. They will bombard them until the ground bounces. And then they will go in, and they’ll go street to street.”

If the Russian military uses those tactics to assault the capital, Kyiv — a city of nearly 3 million — and other densely populated areas such as Dnipro and Odessa, it will mark a particularly grave turn. Already, a million people have fled the violence in Ukraine.

As the war grinds on, the conflict may also become less visible. Early on, international journalists have closely covered the invasion from Kyiv and other cities that still have electricity, Internet and cellphone service. But if Russian forces disable local utilities, as they have in Mariupol, the developments will become far more difficult to broadcast.

Mariupol’s capture, a prime Russian objective ever since a separatist war broke out in the country’s east in 2014, would help Moscow to complete a “land bridge” from Russian territory to Crimea on the Black Sea.

Ukrainian cities that are less fortified or strategic may escape similar sieges. The Russian military recently captured Kherson, an important economic hub along the Black Sea and the Dnieper River, without resorting to the days-long bombardment it has used in Mariupol. Big cities such as Kyiv that the Ukrainian military is gearing up to defend, however, could well be pummeled — at great cost to those who remain.

Mason Clark, the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said the Russian military used a similar playbook in Syria as it fought alongside the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, often targeting civilian infrastructure to force a city or part of it to capitulate.

“They likely assess that it is a more cost-efficient way of forcing these cities to surrender,” Clark said.

The Russian military all but leveled Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, during the first Chechen war, in the 1990s, and in the second, which began just before Vladimir Putin became Russia’s president in 2000.

Clark said the aim of the Russian military in Grozny was not just to force Chechen separatists to capitulate but to destroy the city itself as a way to break their will. It’s not clear whether Moscow has the same aims in Kyiv, he said, noting that the Ukrainian capital could see comparable destruction anyway.

In a post on the messaging service Telegram, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko encouraged residents to have faith in the ultimate victory of Ukrainian forces, describing the siege there as an “act of genocide by Russian occupiers against the Ukrainian people.”

Russia has presented the invasion as an effort to “denazify and demilitarize” the country and rescue Ukrainians from a Western-backed government that has been holding them hostage. On Friday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told U.N. Secretary General António Guterres that the Russian military was using high-precision munitions and had created humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

Boichenko said that Mariupol has emergency services ready to restore electricity and water but that a cease-fire is needed to carry out that work.

“We aren’t simply saying it, we are screaming it, so the international community hears our voice about the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe for our city,” Boichenko said Thursday.

He said negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials regarding humanitarian corridors had raised hopes that medicines and food would be allowed into the city.

In addition to Ukrainian forces, Mariupol has been a primary base for years for the Azov Battalion, a far-right militia that has been involved in fighting for Ukraine since the start of the separatist conflict in 2014. Those fighters have been a particular target for Russian forces and its separatist proxies, who have sought to highlight the existence of far-right groups in Ukraine to falsely label the central government as being run by neo-Nazis.

In cities across Ukraine, locals have begun building barriers to impede Russian armored vehicles from easily entering and have stocked up on molotov cocktails and guns in preparation for urban combat. Advancing Russian commanders will probably try to avoid urban combat as much as they can for fear it will lead to a large number of Russian casualties. The result is likely to be a reliance on airstrikes and artillery, in addition to siege tactics, all of which can cause significant death among civilians.

“I don’t know what other outcome there is other than winning ugly for Russia at this point,” said Scott Boston, a Russian military analyst at Rand Corp.

The Russian air force hasn’t been very involved in the military operation so far, Boston said, and he would expect to see more airstrikes as forces try to close in on Kyiv.

He said the Russian military faces logistical problems that could inhibit its ability to move the huge amount of ammunition needed to surround big cities and shell them into capitulation, as in Mariupol. The military, he said, would need to amass an overwhelming amount of combat power to launch an operation inside a city as big as Kyiv, and it would become difficult for the Russians the longer such fighting dragged on.

“The longer it goes,” Boston said, “the worse it will be.”

Following days of intense shelling, residents in the port city of Mariupol were left without power and water after Russian missiles struck critical infrastructure.

Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the city ""came under enemy fire"" by Russian forces in continuing ""ruthless attacks"".

It is understood the city remains in Ukrainian hands, but British intelligence says it is ""highly likely"" Mariupol is surrounded by Russian forces, as well as the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy.

Key developments:

If the key port city were to fall, it would allow Moscow to create a land corridor between Crimea and the rebel-led regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.

Multiple staff members of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported dire conditions in Mariupol and are sheltering in the city with their families.

They said that the ""shelling was harder and closer"" overnight and that queues for water in the city are ""huge"" while pharmacies have run out of medicine.

Multiple supermarkets have been destroyed by missiles and the remaining items were taken by ""people in desperate need"".

There is still no power, water, heating and mobile connection in Mariupol, the MSF said, adding that no one heard about any evacuation yet.

Ukraine has said Russian soldiers are not observing an agreed temporary ceasefire to allow civilians in the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha in southern Ukraine to flee, which was established earlier today.

In Kyiv, a vast Russian armoured column threatening the Ukrainian capital remains stalled on the outskirts.

But Russia's military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued northwest of Kyiv.

In the south of Kyiv, a Russian airstrike on a residential area in Markhalivka killed seven people, including two children.

Homes burn down in Chernihiv

As homes in Chernihiv burned following Russian shelling, one resident accused Europe of being a bystander as the violence rages on.

""We wanted to join NATO and the EU and this is the price we are paying, and NATO cannot protect us,"" she said.

Another frightened Chernihiv woman was devastated after her house was set on fire.

""I was asleep and they (Russians) started to shoot, and the fire broke out. Now we are burning down,"" she said.

""My house was hit twice. A first time and then a second. What have you done to my house and to the country you fascist?"", she said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""He is an imbecile. How the whole world cannot stop him?""

Ukraine says that more than 840 children have been wounded in the invasion, and 28 have been killed.

The United Nations has said at least 351 civilians have been killed and 707 injured since the war with Russia erupted in Ukraine 10 days ago. However, the agency admits the number is likely to be ""considerably higher"".

Ukraine claims at least 2,000 civilians have died in the conflict.

What is happening in other cities?

Russian forces made their biggest advances in the south in the past week, where they captured their first sizeable Ukrainian city, Kherson.

Bombing subsequently worsened in northeastern cities including Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Okhtyrka in recent days.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said Ukrainian forces are still in control of Chernihiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv and had defended the biggest port city, Odesa, from Russian ships.

Verified footage circulating on social media showed brave citizens in Kherson coming out to protest against the Russian occupation on Saturday.

The small city of Volnovakha, to the north of Mariupol, has also been subjected to significant Russian attacks since 24 February.

While Russian troops continue to advance on Kyiv, with missiles striking the city centre in recent days, fighting has also been noted on the outskirts of the city - including in Markhalivka, where seven people were killed yesterday.

1.3 million people flee Ukraine

The United Nations has confirmed that well over a million Ukrainian refugees have fled their home country since the conflict with Russia began.

These are largely women and children, as men of fighting age - those aged between 18 and 60 - have been urged to stay behind by President Zelenskyy and defend Ukraine.

The UN says this has quickly become the ""biggest refugee crisis this century"", predicting that as many as four million people could leave.

Kyiv's central train station remained crowded with people desperate to escape the conflict. ""People just want to live,"" one woman told reporters.

In the western city of Lviv, thousands of people waited for hours on Friday outside the railway station at the western city to board trains heading to Poland, with many families arriving with few belongings.

The State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a Facebook post that the Zaporizhzhia plant was being ""occupied by the military forces of the Russian Federation,"" according to an NBC News translation.

The occupation came after a fire in a training building at the plant, which triggered calls for troops to immediately retreat amid fears of nuclear danger.

The fire was declared to be out around 6:20 a.m. local time, and there were no victims, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement, according to an NBC News translation.

Units at the plant remained intact, the inspectorate said. Though there was damage to the reactor compartment of one unit, the damage did not affect the unit's safety, the office said.

There have been no changes in the radiation status at the plant, the inspectorate said.

The latest developments on Ukraine:

Ukraine and Russia tentatively agree to create humanitarian corridors that would allow for safe evacuations of civilians.

Biden administration offers temporary immigration status to Ukrainian citizens in the U.S.

Busloads of volunteers cross Polish border into Ukraine to help fight against Russian forces.

While the blaze burned, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said on Twitter that if the power plant blows up “it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl.”

“Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia,” Kuleba tweeted. “Fire has already broke out.”

He called for an immediate ceasefire in the vicinity of the plant.

Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant in Enerhodar, said in a video posted on Telegram that there “is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.”

The attack had prevented firefighters from immediately accessing the nuclear plant, the State Emergency Service said on Facebook, adding that rescuers were on standby.

The country’s emergency services department later said there was a fire in a training building behind the plant, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said no “essential” equipment had been damaged.

The agency added that there was no change in radiation levels at the site. The White House later said that its latest information showed ""no indications of elevated levels of radiation.""

President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the fire. In a summary of the call released by the White House, Biden urged Russia to stop military activities in the area so firefighters and emergency responders could get to the site.

The fresh tensions in Ukraine came just hours after a second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials ended with the two sides tentatively agreeing to establish humanitarian corridors for the safe evacuation of civilians caught in the crossfire and the delivery of supplies to those staying in the country.

“I think this is a significant progress,” Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator on the ceasefire talks, said in a video message.

More than 1 million people have already fled Ukraine in a rapid exodus after a week of war, as Russia’s military bombarded key cities across the country amid staunch resistance to the invasion.

The conflict has fueled a growing humanitarian crisis in Europe, and left those who have remained in Ukraine facing an intensifying assault from the air and the ground.

But a mileslong Russian military convoy threatening the Ukrainian capital has made little progress over the last three days. Russian forces’ northern advance has faced a fierce Ukrainian defense and its own logistical issues. They appear to have had made more significant gains in the south, with one key port city under Russian control and another struggling to hold out under siege.

The bombardment didn’t look like it would end anytime soon.

Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, an Élysée Presidential Palace source said, describing it as “not-so-friendly.”

Putin said the campaign would continue unless Ukraine accepted Moscow’s conditions, the source said.

The Russian leader told Macron in the call that the “situation will get worse, but Ukraine chose it,” the source said. “Putin’s goal is to take control of all of Ukraine,” they added.

Zelenskyy called on residents to keep up their resistance, while branding Russian soldiers “children who are being used.”

Moscow faced further international isolation and condemnation. But the country vowed to press on with the war even as officials from both sides sat down for a second round of talks in Belarus that concluded without any significant breakthroughs.

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator, said his team agreed with Ukrainian negotiators to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military has established channels to communicate directly with the Russian military as a way to deconflict tactical movements around Ukraine, according to a senior defense official.

'Humanitarian catastrophe'

From the capital, Kyiv, to Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south, Russia’s advances have brought destruction to major Ukrainian cities and civilian areas.

The bombardment of Ukrainian cities has pushed residents to flee to neighboring countries and forced many more of the nation's 44 million residents to seek shelter underground or head west by road or train.

“I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one,” Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said in a statement issued Thursday.

In Lviv, a city in the country's west that has become a hub for international diplomats and the news media, trains heading out of Ukraine are packed with families desperate to make it to safety.

Many are wheeling small suitcases and carrying backpacks containing all the possessions they could carry. In the frigid temperatures, parents are wrapped up in thick winter coats and hats, their children’s faces scared.

Serheii Shpak, 28, said it took two days for his family to make it from Kharkiv to Lviv. He decided it was time to leave after sheltering in the metro system with his 1-year-old son and wife while Russian forces shelled the city.

He said the journey was filled with panicked Ukrainians trying to make it to safety. “The carriages were really crowded,” said Shpak, a web developer.

He said he planned to head to nearby Vinnytsia so his family could start a new life further from the threat of Russian attacks.

The Unites States will extend what's known as temporary protected status, which would allow them to remain in the country without fear of deportation, for 18 months to Ukrainian nationals on U.S. soil as of March 1, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced Thursday. People who enter the U.S. after that date will not be eligible.

""Our hearts stand with the Ukrainian people who are suffering so much tragedy and so much loss,"" Mayorkas said in a video posted to Twitter. ""We will do everything in our power to support them.""

The Biden administration Thursday also asked Congress to provide $10 billion in humanitarian and defense assistance for Ukraine.
