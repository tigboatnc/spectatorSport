Russian forces have launched an invasion of Ukraine, with troops entering the country from the east, from Belarus in the north, and Crimea in the south.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address, announcing a military operation to demilitarise and ‘de-nazify’ Ukraine.

Ukraine’s air defence systems have largely been disabled.

Multiple cities across the country have been struck by missiles and artillery shells, including Kyiv, Odessa, Kharkiv, and Mariupol.

Ukraine has declared a state of emergency and closed its airspace to all civilian traffic.

Road and rail routes out of the country are largely congested due to the number of people attempting to evacuate.

Situation

Early on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address to the nation during which he announced the commencement of a military operation to demilitarise and ‘de-nazify’ Ukraine. President Putin warned other countries against inhibiting Russia’s actions in Ukraine, stating that Russia’s actions would lead to “consequences that you have never faced in your history”. While Vladimir Putin was still talking, multiple explosions were reported around the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Following this, explosions targeted areas of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk, and more. The Russian forces subsequently launched a campaign to disable Ukraine’s air defence systems, primarily targeting military airbases.



Following the initial stages, columns of Russian ground forces entered Ukrainian territory from the east, from Belarus in the north, and from Crimea in the south. Armed clashes have occurred between Ukrainian and Russian forces in multiple areas of the country. The use of thermobaric, cruise and ballistic missile systems has been documented, primarily against military structures. One of the heaviest confrontations is believed to be around Antonov International Airport in Hostomel, approximately 25 kilometres northwest of central Kyiv. Videos have been shared online showing Russian attack helicopters surrounding the airport, with large columns of smoke emerging from the site.

Ground forces are also believed to be engaging in combat at the airport. The level of fighting in close proximity to Kyiv has raised concerns that Russian forces will attempt to capture the capital city in the coming hours. Heavy fighting has also been recorded around the Antonovskiy Bridge, leading into Kherson, and Russian forces are believed to have entered the city. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has alleged that four ballistic missiles have been fired from Belarusian territory in the southwest direction.

The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that Russian forces are attempting to gain control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, calling the action “a declaration of war against the whole of Europe”. Although the primary targets appear to be military bases and infrastructure, civilian casualties have been documented on several occasions. A video has surfaced showing a fighter jet firing at least two rockets towards a civilian housing complex. The exact figures of civilian and military fatalities are unavailable.



The previous night, Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada approved a 30-day state of emergency to be imposed at midnight. The state of emergency allows the country’s authorities to restrict freedom of movement, inspect vehicles, ""strengthen the protection of public order"", restrict the sale of alcohol and weapons, prohibit public gatherings, impose curfews, and regulate broadcast outlets. Then, following the invasion, the Ukrainian government imposed martial law and closed the country’s airspace. Currently, civilian flights are disallowed from operating services to and from Ukraine, limiting evacuation options. Multiple roads leading west have become heavily congested, due to the volume of people attempting to evacuate the country. Likewise, videos surfaced today showing large crowds queuing outside Kyiv’s main railway station (Pasazhyrskyi), implying that rail options are also congested.

Russia’s actions have been met with widespread international condemnation. The United Kingdom’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, delivers a televised address during which he denounced Russia’s actions, labelling President Putin as a “dictator”, and stated that a “massive package” of sanctions will be imposed, asserting “we will do whatever it takes” to support Ukraine. Moldova and Latvia have both declared a state of emergency, while the Finnish Prime Minister, Sanna Marin, has announced that her country is ready to apply for NATO membership, “if it becomes a matter of national security”. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, has labelled the invasion as a “brutal act of war” and announced that the bloc is increasing its presence in the eastern European members and heightening the readiness of the NATO Response Force. At an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting, each member was largely critical of the Russian invasion, and the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, stated that Russia has declared war on Ukraine.



Analysis and Implications

The Russian authorities are believed to have several objectives in conducting its invasion of Ukraine. Primarily, it is understood that Russia is seeking to remove the incumbent Ukrainian authorities from power. Russia views the post-2014 Ukrainian governments as a threat to its national security, hence the operation to demilitarise the country. It remains to be seen whether Russia will annex any more of Ukraine’s territory. However, it is probable that if Russia is successful in removing Ukraine’s administration, it will install a new pro-Russian government. In such an event, it is possible that an insurgency will be carried out by the Ukrainian population, something that is being actively encouraged by the country’s armed forces.

President Zelensky announced that Ukraine will give weapons to anyone willing to defend it, stating that people should “be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities”. If this occurs, it is possible that Russian troops could remain in Ukraine for an extended period to quell any pockets of resistance. Already, videos have surfaced showing troops from Rosgvardiya deployed inside Ukrainian territory, specifically, in Henichesk, situated in the Kherson Oblast. Rosgvardiya constitutes Russia’s domestic armed forces who have previously been deployed to Belarus in order to quell protest activities. This suggests that the Russian government is planning a long-term operation in Ukraine.



The invasion of Ukraine is already having impacts on global financial markets, and sanctions are likely to worsen the situation. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion’s commencement, the value of the Russian rouble fell by approximately 20 percent, before achieving a slight recovery. The price of oil has reached its highest level since 2014, at 105 USD per barrel. The FTSE 100 share index fell this morning by 3 percent, London-listed Russian company Sberbank’s share price fell by 61 percent and Gazprom’s fell by 28 percent. Wheat prices have also increased sharply, to approximately 390 USD per tonne, which is thought to be the largest price rise for nine years. The full scale of economic impact remains to be seen, but fuel and gas prices are expected to rise.



The risk to traveller safety is critical, civilian fatalities have been reported on multiple occasions and there is no guarantee that fighting will happen exclusively outside civilian zones. Worsening the risk, are the limited availability of transport options. With all civilian flights suspended alongside road and rail options being heavily congested, it is likely that difficulties will arise when attempting to evacuate the country. Ukrainian authorities have set up bomb shelters in the major cities, including the capital, many of which are in underground railway stations.

The United States Embassy to Ukraine currently advises that people should shelter-in-place. Both sides have accused the other of spreading lies and launching disinformation campaigns, indicating that verifiable information is limited, possibility impeding the ability of travellers to keep abreast of the current situation.





Advice

Defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine.

Ensure that travel passports and travel documents are up to date and regularly review possible departure options.

Where applicable, travellers in Ukraine should familiarise themselves with plans to evacuate the country and/or implement robust security measures.

Regularly monitor reputable national and international news reports for situational updates over the coming days and weeks, keeping in mind the rifeness of disinformation campaigns.

Eksplozje słychać w wielu ukraińskich miastach. Pod ostrzałem znalazły się nie tylko cele wojskowe, ale także infrastruktura cywilna. Media informują o zabitych i rannych.

Najpierw Rosjanie zorganizowali zmasowany cyberatak wymierzony głównie na administrację publiczną oraz instytucje rządowe na Ukrainie i uderzyli w strony internetowe banków i ministerstw. Później nastąpił atak militarny. Władimir Putin oskarżył Kijów o rozlew krwi w Donbasie i zapowiedział reakcję. Uzasadniał ją pomocą dla uznanych przez Rosję tzw. samozwańczych republik – Donieckiej i Ługańskiej.

– Postanowiłem przeprowadzić specjalną operację wojskową, której celem jest ochrona osób od ośmiu lat zastraszanych i poddawanych ludobójstwu przez reżim kijowski. Będziemy dążyć do demilitaryzacji Ukrain – mówił Władimir Putin.

Na wschodzie Ukrainy rozgorzały walki. Wojska rosyjskie miały przekroczyć granicę w obwodach czernichowskim, sumskim, ługańskam i charkowskim. Media piszą od rana o wybuchach w Odessie, Charkowie i Mariupolu. Donosiły też o bombardowaniach w okolicy Lwowa, Łucka i Kijowa. Początkowo informowano o atakach rakietowych na ukraińską infrastrukturę wojskową i lotniczą. Popołudniu pojawiły się info o tym, że Rosjanie zaczęli atakować infrastrukturę cywilną.

– Dwanaście pierwszych godzin ataku ma bardzo krwawy i dramatyczny bilans. Ukraina straciła już bardzo dużo swoich sił. Widać, że zwłaszcza obrona przeciwlotnicza została w dużym stopniu zniszczona, w zasadzie jest na granicy prowadzenia jakichkolwiek operacji. Wydaje się, że będzie 1:0 dla Putina – powiedziała dr Paulina Polko z Katedry Nauk o Bezpieczeństwie Akademii WSB.

W mieście Wuhłedar pod ostrzałem znalazł się szpital, a w Mariupolu rakietami Grad ostrzeliwane są dzielnice mieszkalne.

W Kijowie doszło do eksplozji.

Prezydent Ukrainy wezwał obywateli do podjęcia działań.

– Już rozdajemy broń i rozdamy ją w obronie naszego kraju każdemu, kto chce i ma zdolność obrony naszej suwerenności. Przyszłość Ukrainy zależy od każdego obywatela – poinformował prezydent Ukrainy, Wołodymyr Zełenski.

– Jestem z Lwowa. Uważam, że musimy zmobilizować i odeprzeć wszystkich, którzy wkraczają do naszego kraju. Proszę mi wybaczyć, że to mówię, ale myślę, że musimy walczyć z tymi wszystkimi, którzy tak mocno najeżdżają nasz kraj, (…) którzy biorą udział w tym ogromnym bałaganie. Zabierzemy nasze dzieci w bezpieczne miejsce i wrócimy do walki – podkreślił jeden z Ukraińców.

– Tam o nas walczą nasi chłopcy na wschodniej Ukrainie. Modlimy się za nich. Mamy nadzieję, że Bóg nas uratuje, a nasi sąsiedzi wesprą nas i pomogą – dodała jedna z Ukrainek. – Jest naprawdę wojna, ale wojna trwa już od ośmiu lat, a teraz rozpoczęła się oficjalna wojna. Dziękuję wszystkim wam za modlitwę, bo odczuwamy to, no i dalej prosimy o modlitwę – dodał Mikołaj z Lwowa.

Władimir Putin tłumaczył dziś rosyjskim biznesmenom, że Rosja została zmuszona do podjęcia takich kroków. Stwierdził, że to wina Zachodu, który odmówił ustąpienia wobec rosyjskich żądań bezpieczeństwa.

– Wszystko, co się dzieje, jest środkiem desperackim. Nie zostawili nam innej opcji. Stworzyli takie zagrożenie bezpieczeństwa, że nie mogliśmy zareagować inaczej – oznajmił prezydent Rosji.

Ukraińska armia potrzebuje wsparcia – mówił prezydent Ukrainy, Wołodymyr Zełenski. Kraj poinformował o pojmaniu dwóch rosyjskich jeńców i zestrzeleniu rosyjskich samolotów.

– Ukraińskie siły zbrojne brały udział w ciężkich walkach, aby odeprzeć ataki w Donbasie i w innych regionach: na wschodzie, północy i południu. Wróg poniósł poważne straty i poniesie ich znacznie więcej. Przybyli na naszą ziemię – powiedział Wołodymyr Zełenski.

Prezydent Ukrainy zerwał stosunki dyplomatyczne z Rosją. Zaapelował o oddawanie krwi.

– W tej chwili tworzymy rezerwy, ale nie mogę powiedzieć czy wystarczą, czy nie – wskazała Ukrainka.

Na Ukrainie cały system opieki zdrowotnej działa w trybie ciągłej gotowości. Nie wiadomo, jak długo potrwa rosyjska agresja – zaakcentował ekspert ds. bezpieczeństwa, Sebastian Trojak.

– To jest beczka prochu. Wystarczy mała iskra, jakaś nieodpowiedzialna decyzja i dojdzie do eskalacji na niespotykaną skalę. Wojska ukraińskie są zdeterminowane i gotowe do obrony. To jest 22. armia świata, jeśli chodzi o przygotowanie do działań wojennych – podsumował Sebastian Trojak.

Na działania wojenne nie godzą się sami Rosjanie. W wielu miastach w Rosji doszło dziś do protestów. Reżim Władimira Putina aresztował ponad tysiąc osób sprzeciwiających się rozpętaniu wojny.
