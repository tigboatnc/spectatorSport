“In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighbouring countries,” UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi tweeted. “Unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine.”

Russian troops were in the centre of the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson on Thursday after a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had captured a major urban centre for the first time in its eight-day invasion.

The capture of Kherson, a strategic southern provincial capital where the Dnieper River flows into the Black Sea, is the first significant city to fall since Moscow launched its attack on February 24.

Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv continues to come under heavy Russian shelling, with police and university buildings among the latest struck.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) says a member of its observer mission died in the shelling.

Russia denies targeting civilians although there have been widespread reports of non-combatant casualties and the targeting of residential areas.

But it is here, and in nearby Volnovakha, that the illegal tactics of terrorising civilians for military aims, honed in Syria and then brought back so close to home, have reached a grim high point.

There have been terrible strikes on homes, schools and hospitals around Ukraine. But residents of both towns say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and airstrikes since the start of the war has damaged or destroyed nearly every building in their towns, a comprehensive devastation as yet unmatched elsewhere.

The Russian flag has now been raised over the ruins of Schastia. In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, says local MP Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainians still brave enough to run rescue missions are going back only for the living.

Thousands of them are trapped in basements, with dwindling supplies of food and water, sheltering from an apparently senseless attack on a town Lubinets says has no military defenders in its centre. The line of contact is 20km away, he says.

“It never stops, every five minutes there is a mortar landing or artillery shells, some buildings have been hit by multiple rocket systems,” he said by phone.

“In the city there is not any building which has not suffered from direct or collateral damage. So some buildings have major destruction, some minor destruction, some are completely destroyed to the ground.”

On Friday morning, Ukrainian media claimed that a Russian war plane bombing “residential areas and civilian infrastructure” in the area was shot down.

Pavlo*, a Schastia native who evacuated his family, said 80% of the town was damaged in an intense bombardment that lasted days, and as in Volnovakha, barely any buildings were entirely untouched.

“People started evacuation after three days, when Russian forces stopped bombing the town and people could leave the shelters,” he said. “People didn’t have water, gas, electricity for three or four days because of the bombing. They used all kinds of their weapons, Grad rockets, artillery and mines.”

The devastation in larger cities such as Chernihiv and Kharkiv is deadly and terrible, but has still affected only a relatively small portion of the towns, even if the terror it instils casts a shadow over every civilian still trapped there.

But what Russian forces appear to show in these smaller towns is that they are willing to leave behind them a wasteland on a massive scale, as they did in Grozny in Chechnya, or – together with Syrian forces – in the ancient city of Aleppo. Neither humanity nor heritage stopped them.

Attacking civilians, and the infrastructure that supports life including hospitals and schools, is illegal under international law. It has no direct strategic advantage for an advancing army. But it is extremely effective at breaking morale of a resisting population.

The “I love Volnovakha” sign in the centre of town, which has survived somehow, has a backdrop of ruined houses. It appears at the start of a video, filmed from a moving car, which captures crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris.

Before the war, the population of the town was 25,000. Lubinets says at least 3,000 people are trapped, but possibly many more. Hundreds of them are children. Requests for a humanitarian evacuation corridor have gone unanswered, so the military and other volunteers are risking their lives to bring people out in small groups.

“We drive under fire to the places where people mostly concentrated, schools, hospitals, grab them out, put them in the car and bring them out, because the shelling never stops at any second,” he said.

“Its impossible to use buses because they have low mobility. Always when you go there you will get punctures, so you just have to drive [the car] out for about 10 minutes to places where big buses can come.”

For many residents of these towns, their lives are as irreparably shattered as their homes, barely a week into this war. Their suffering may be a terrible template for the damage Russia will inflict on others, if Moscow tries to pound bigger towns and cities into submission.

“There was life before, and life after, and now I just feel emptiness inside,” said Iyrna*, who fled in a long, lonely journey through a succession of towns and cities under attack – first Chernihiv, then Kyiv and finally to relative safety in the western city of Lviv. “Nobody knows what is going on there.”

“A friend [still in Schastia] told me: ‘I can’t even go to your place to try and collect some papers, or other things, everything there is totally smashed up,’” she said. “Ninety per cent of houses are damaged.”

She was just out of hospital after major surgery when the war began, and her husband is serving on the frontline. “For three days I was in such deep stress I couldn’t eat or drink, even now they have been swept out of my memory. I was so exhausted I had hallucinations that my husband was with me.”

Shastia and Volnovakha were on the frontline for eight years of the smaller-scale war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists, and Lubinets believes the carnage inflicted on the towns now is revenge for their resilience through those years.

“From the very first day of the war they started shelling us directly … They are trying to wipe out the town,” he said. “I think someone in Russia is destroying [the town] as a reminder of what they can do to someone who doesn’t break in the face of Russian aggression.”

Explosions have rocked Ukraine's capital Kyiv overnight amid widespread uncertainty over whether Russia will launch a full assault on the capital in the coming hours and days. Massive blasts were heard and filmed in the city last night, with one video on social media showing a huge fireball rising in the city's sky. It's unknown what the targets of the explosions were, or whether there have been casualties caused by the blasts. NBC News is working to verify camera footage posted online purporting to show explosions hitting the city. More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the Russian invasion a week ago, but many have stayed and taken up arms to fight Russian forces. Many of Kyiv's residents, including children, also remain in the city, living or seeking shelter in subway stations, basements and underground bunkers when air raid sirens warn of incoming strikes.

Russia has said Kyiv's residents will be allowed to evacuate the city in the direction of Vasylkiv, to the southwest of the city. ""There will not be any obstacles from Russian military personnel for the exit of the civilian population,"" Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, said on Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency TASS. This is the second time that Russia has warned Kyiv's residents to leave the city, with Konashenkov insisting on Monday that the route toward Vasylkiv was ""open and safe,"" despite reports of Russian missile strikes on the town.

The convoy

As many residents of Kyiv take shelter in underground stations and bunkers, the decision of whether to stay or go — and to risk possible harm and death in the process of leaving — has become acute this week, particularly as concerns grow that Russia could be poised to launch an all-out assault on the city. Fears have grown after satellite images emerged at the start of the week showing a huge convoy of Russian military vehicles, estimated to be around 40 miles long, slowly snaking its way toward the capital. The following satellite image was taken by U.S firm Maxar Technologies on Monday. It appears to show a convoy of Russian armored tanks and trucks that stretched from Pybirsk, further north of Kyiv, to the Antonov airport (also known as the Hostomel airport — the site of fighting last week between Russian and Ukrainian forces) on the northwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

The convoy has reportedly been held up on its way to Kyiv, however, amid unconfirmed reports of food and fuel shortages. When asked about the convoy's progress and position at a press briefing on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Department Spokesman John Kirby said ""we still assess that that convoy, but more broadly speaking the northern push by the Russians down towards the south, towards Kyiv, remains stalled."" ""From our best estimates have not made any appreciable progress geographically speaking in the last 24 to 36 hours,"" he added. The U.S. defense official believed there were several reasons for the delay: ""One, we believe the Russians are deliberately, actually, regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up for lost time. Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistics and sustainment challenges, challenges that we don't believe they fully anticipated."" Lastly, he said, Russian forces have experienced ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" with indications — although the U.S. could not completely independently verify them — that ""Ukrainians have in fact tried to slow down that convoy."" Britain's Ministry of Defense confirmed the United States' assessment of the convoy on Thursday, issuing an intelligence update in which it said ""the main body of the large Russian column … remains over 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion."" The ministry also believed that ""the column has made little discernible progress in over three days."" Jack Watling, a research fellow for land warfare and military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said there were a number of logistical challenges that the convoy faces. ""When you have that many vehicles on a very small number of roads you need to move fuel and food and large quantities of it along that road so you're continually having to move the vehicles aside and then at the other end you're having to work who's going to go where and what they're going to do,"" he said. ""So I think the Russians are trying to sort themselves out, as it were, and shake out at the other end and prepare for what they want to do to Kyiv,"" he told the BBC's ""Today"" program on Thursday.

Dire situation

Kyiv is only one of the a number of key cities that Russian forces are hoping to seize following their invasion of Ukraine. Other key strategic cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have been the scenes of fierce fighting. There are reports that Russian forces have taken control of Kherson in the south, with the city's mayor announcing on Facebook Wednesday evening that Russians had imposed a curfew and other rules on residents. The mayor, Igor Kolykhayev, warned residents not to provoke the Russian military.
