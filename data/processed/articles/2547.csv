I am sincerely enraptured by the Ukrainians, who come empty-handed and expel the occupiers from their cities! We will chase them away with disgrace! As when they attempt to find some food. They are not the soldiers of a state. These are just lost and used children!

Almost 9 thousand killed Russians in one week. They have to take their dead and wounded 19 and 20-year-old people by tens of helicopters from the Nikolayevsk side…
