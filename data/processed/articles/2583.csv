Eight military personnel have died after their helicopter and fighter jet crashed separately in bad weather in eastern Romania near the Black Sea, marking the worst day of air force accidents in recent years.

The European Union member is on the front line to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank as Russia wages its all-out war in neighbouring Ukraine, and has seen international reinforcements arrive in recent weeks.

The IAR 330 Puma helicopter crashed on Wednesday in the area of Gura Dobrogei, 11km (seven miles) from the airfield, killing all seven on board, the defence ministry said.

It was searching for the MiG-21 LanceR, shortly after the fighter jet – part of a formation of two MiG-21 LanceR planes performing air patrol missions – lost contact and disappeared from the radar.

Later on Wednesday, the fighter jet was also found, having crashed near Cogealac, an uninhabited area near the Black Sea, the defence ministry said. The 31-year-old pilot died, it said.

‘Tragic night’

“It is premature to discuss possible causes. Certainly, there were unfavourable weather conditions, but we can’t comment now,” spokesman General Constantin Spanu said on local television on Wednesday.

The helicopter pilot had reported adverse weather conditions and had been ordered to return to base, according to the ministry.

All IAR 330 Puma and MiG LanceR aircraft will be grounded while the cause of the crash is under investigation.

On Thursday, military and religious commemoration ceremonies for the victims will be held in all Romanian military units.

President Klaus Iohannis in a statement on Wednesday evening sent his “thoughts to the bereaved families” of the crash victims on what he called “a tragic night for Romanian aviation”.

In July 2010, 12 people were killed and two injured when an AN-2 aircraft crashed on a parachute training flight mission, shortly after takeoff.

This led Romania’s army to give up the aircraft type, no longer considered safe.

Later that month, six Israeli soldiers and a Romanian died when their helicopter crashed in central Romania.

Crashes of the MiG-21 LanceR occur occasionally.

In 2018, a Romanian Air Force pilot died after his MiG-21 LanceR crashed during an air show in the southeast of the country.

The Romanian Air Force still relies on the Soviet-era MiGs for missions of air policing, though it is modernising its aircraft.

NATO’s eastern flank

Romania, a former member of the communist bloc now part of NATO and the European Union, has seen tens of thousands of refugees arrive since Russia invaded its neighbour Ukraine last week.

Over the past months of growing regional tensions, Romania has repeatedly demanded reinforcements be sent to NATO’s eastern flank. Its allies have responded.

The United States has sent a squadron of Stryker armoured vehicles and about 1,000 troops in recent weeks to a Romanian base near the Black Sea, adding to the 900 personnel already stationed in the country.

And over the past month, six Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft from Germany’s air force have joined four similar planes Italy dispatched before the crisis.

More than 500 French soldiers are being sent to the eastern European country this week.","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/3/army-helicopter-fighter-jet-crash-in-romania-killing-all-crew#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20a%20Romanian%20Air,it%20is%20modernising%20its%20aircraft."

The fate of that fighter jet remains unclear after it went missing while flying over the Black Sea.

The Romanian Ministry of Defense said the IAR-330 came down near Gura Dobrogei, approximately 11 kilometers (~7 miles) from Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base where it had taken off. An official statement said that contact with the helicopter was lost after the pilot had reported bad weather and had been told to return to base. A second IAR-330 that was expected to also head out to look for the MiG-21 was subsequently grounded.

Contact was lost with the Lancer shortly after it took off from Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base, which is situated near Constanța on Romania's Black Sea coast, on a routine patrol mission earlier this evening. In addition to the IAR-330, Romania's Inspectorate for Emergency Situations, or ISU, had dispatched teams based in Constanța to assist on the ground with the search for the missing jet, according to the Ministry of National Defense.

An earlier official statement on the missing MiG-21., Romanian Ministry of National Defense via Facebook

While we don't know the circumstances behind either of these incidents yet, there is no indication at this time that foul play or hostile action of any kind was a factor in the crash of the IAR-330 or the MiG-21 going missing. There are signs that bad weather might have played a role in incidents.

At the same time, this all does come amid major regional tensions emanating from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Just yesterday, a pair of Romanian MiG-21s escorted a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet back to that country's airspace. That jet had landed in Romania for still unclear reasons on the first day of that conflict, January 24. You can read more about all of that in detail here.

Hopefully, Romanian authorities will be able to ascertain the fate of the MiG-21 soon and that the outcome there will turn out to be more positive.

Update 5:00 PM EST:

Romanian Ministry of National Defense has now issued a new statement, a copy of which along with translation is seen in full below, regarding the IAR-330 crash and the missing MiG-21. It now says that seven individuals died in the helicopter crash. The initial figure did not include two additional Romanian Navy personnel on board at the time of the incident.

It's unclear whether the MiG-21 crash site has been located, but this new statement says that, regardless, the pilot of that aircraft has not yet been found.

Video of the crashed IAR-330 has now emerged.

It seems that the Romanian Air Force MiG-21 Lancer was mistakenly shot down by a Ukraine S-300SPS SAM.

Do you remember the Romanian Air Force (RoAF) MiG-21 Lancer fighter jet that crashed on Mar. 2, 2022?

According to Avia-Pro.net, it seems that the Lancer was mistakenly shot down by a Ukraine S-300 SAM.

Romania’s defence ministry said the aircraft was part of a formation of two MiG-21 Lancer planes performing air patrol missions over Dobrogea in order to prevent violations of the country’s border. However, Ukrainian air defense systems mistakenly mistook the MiG-21 for an enemy aircraft and opened fire against it.

More details are provided by Mail Bd that claims;

‘In Romania, they said that the MiG-21 aircraft of the national air force was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile of the air defense of Ukraine. Presumably, it was a missile of the S-300PS complex.

‘Earlier Ukrainian media claimed that the MiG-21 Lancer fighter of the Romanian Air Force crashed.

‘The plane disappeared from radar while flying over the Black Sea. A rescue helicopter was sent to search for him, which also crashed, this was confirmed by the Romanian Air Force.

‘As officially announced in Bucharest, the IAR 330 helicopter went in the evening in search of the MiG-21 Lancer, with which radio contact was lost. The pilot managed to report bad weather and was ordered to return to base, the Romanian Air Force said in a statement. There were five soldiers on board.’

Taking into account the crash site of the MiG-21 fighter, only the Ukrainian S-300 complex could bring it down.

As we have already explained on Feb. 24, 2022 a Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker landed in Romania after having been intercepted by Romanian Air Force (RoAF) F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets.

The two RoAF F-16 Fighting Falcons were scrambled to intercept the Su-27 while it was approaching the national airspace. After having carried out a visual identification of the Flanker, the F-16s escorted it to the RoAF 95th Air Base in the northeastern Romanian city of Bacău.

As we have then explained, since Moscow identified Ukrainian military airfields and aircraft on the ground as primary targets for its air strikes we assumed that the Su-27 pilot had to land in Romania because he probably had nowhere else to land.

Stay tuned for additional updates if further details on this story had to come to light!

The IAR 330 Puma helicopter that went in search of the plane crashed. Seven soldiers were killed in both crashes.

The Romanian Ministry of Defence issued the following press release:

“The IAR 330-Puma helicopter, which took off on Wednesday, March 2, around 20:21, in a search-and-rescue mission of the Mig 21 LanceR aircraft, lost its radio connection with the control tower and disappeared from the radar around 20:44.

The pilot had reported adverse weather conditions and had been ordered to return to base.

The last known position of the helicopter, which had on board a crew of five soldiers, is the area of Gura Dobrogei, about 11 km from the aerodrome. The condition of the crew or aircraft is unknown. And in this case, the search-and-rescue operations were launched.

There is no definite information yet about the MiG 21 LanceR pilot or aircraft.

We will come back with details.”

A Defence Ministry spokesman has confirmed that the Romanian military rescue chopper had crashed and that there were seven fatalities.

""We will not give up our territory,"" Zelenskiy told CNN in an interview conducted on April 16 and broadcast on April 17.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy said there was no guarantee Russian forces would not try again to take the capital, Kyiv, should its military be successful in the east of Ukraine, adding that the outcome of the war could be decided in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.

“This is why it is very important for us to not allow them, to stand our ground, because this battle...it can influence the course of the whole war,"" Zelenskiy told CNN. ""Because I don't trust the Russian military and Russian leadership.""

""That is why we understand that the fact that we fought them off and they left, and they were running away from Kyiv -- from the north, from Chernihiv and from that direction -- it doesn't mean if they are able to capture Donbas, they won't come further toward Kyiv.""

Russian forces faced tougher-than-expected resistance from Ukrainian troops and civilians in and around the Kyiv area, forcing them to retreat and refocus their efforts on expected attacks in eastern and southern Ukraine.

Russian troops continued to pound Mariupol after claiming they had cleared the urban area of Ukrainian soldiers and had surrounded the remaining troops in a massive steelworks plant.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has vowed a “fight to the end” amid the ruins of Mariupol and said the strategic port city ""has not fallen,"" despite claims by the attacking Russian forces.

Shmyhal told ABC on April 17 that the ""city still has not fallen. There's still our military forces, our soldiers. So they will fight to the end.""

Shmyhal said that Kyiv wanted a diplomatic solution ""if possible,"" but said, ""If the Russians wouldn't like negotiations, we'll fight to the end, absolutely. We will not surrender. We won't leave our country, our families, our land. We will fight to the end.""

Shmyhal again pleaded with the West to send more weapons and ammunition to aid Ukraine’s forces. He also urged nations to send additional financial aid. Ukraine is experiencing a ""huge humanitarian catastrophe"" and needs further help ""to save our economy for future recovery,"" he said.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said that about 2,500 Ukrainian troops remain at Azovstal, a claim that could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials did not mention any numbers for the city defenders.

WATCH: The port city of Mariupol was home to 400,000 people before Russia's invasion. It has been under siege by Russian troops and under constant shelling for more than 50 days. The city has been reduced to rubble, amid claims by Russia that it now has near complete control. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died and tens of thousands remain trapped in the city.

Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said on April 17 that the defenders of Mariupol have tied up significant Russian forces encircling the city. She described Mariupol as a “shield defending Ukraine.”

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine and Russia have failed to agree on humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and wounded Ukrainian troops from Mariupol.

""We have not been able to agree...about cease-fires on evacuation routes. That is why, unfortunately, we are not opening humanitarian corridors today,"" Vereshchuk said on her Telegram account on April 17.

If Russia's capture of Mariupol is confirmed, it would be the first major Ukrainian city to fall since Moscow’s unprovoked war began on February 24.

WATCH: A Ukrainian woman has given RFE/RL a detailed account of how she was raped by a Russian Army soldier. To protect her privacy, we have pixelated her face and we are not disclosing her name. Ukrainian police have been informed of the case.

Capturing Mariupol would allow Russian forces in the south, which came up through the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland and the focus of the anticipated Russian offensive.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said in its regular bulletin that Russian forces continue to redeploy combat and support equipment from Belarus towards eastern Ukraine, including locations close to Kharkiv and Severdonetsk.

Russian artillery continues to strike Ukrainian positions throughout the east of the country, where Russia plans to renew its offensive activity, the ministry said. But it pointed out that even though Russia’s operational focus has shifted to eastern Ukraine, Russia’s ultimate objective remains the same.

“It is committed to compelling Ukraine to abandon its Euro-Atlantic orientation and asserting its own regional dominance,” the ministry said.

At least five people were killed in a series of Russian artillery strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local officials said on April 17. Maksym Khaustov, chief of the Kharkiv region's health department, said the strikes had sparked fires and blown roofs off of buildings throughout the northeastern city.

Oleh Syneyhubov, the governor of the region, said on his Telegram channel that 31 people had been injured in the attacks.

AFP journalists reported hearing two incoming blasts and witnessed five fires in residential areas in the center of Kharkiv, which had a prewar population of 1.4 million people.

Separately, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region, said at least two people were killed and four injured on April 17 in the shelling of the eastern town of Zolote.

Local media reported an explosion in the capital, Kyiv, though Deputy Mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said air-defense systems had thwarted Russian attacks.

A Russian missile attack damaged infrastructure in the Kyiv suburb of Brovary, Ukrainian officials said. Mayor Ihor Sapashko warned that there may be interruptions in water and electricity supplies as the result of the attack.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the military has used precision-guided air-launched missiles to attack the ammunition plant in Brovary overnight.

He said that other Russian air raids also destroyed Ukrainian air-defense radars near Severodonetsk in the east and several ammunition depots elsewhere.

Missile attacks continued in the region around the southern city of Mykolayiv, according to regional Governor Vitali Kim, while officials in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said Russian strikes had killed at least five civilians on April 17.
