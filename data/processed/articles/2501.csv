Ukrainian forces have buried hundreds of people in a mass grave in a commuter town outside Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, after retaking control of the area from Russian troops, according to an official.

“In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves,” Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told the AFP news agency by phone on Saturday.

He said the heavily destroyed town’s streets are littered with corpses.

“All these people were shot, killed, in the back of the head,” Fedoruk said.

He said the victims were men and women, and that he had also seen a 14-year-old boy among the dead.

The mayor also confirmed to Al Jazeera that he had seen at least 22 bodies on Bucha’s streets.

He said it had not been possible to collect the bodies yet, amid fears that Russian forces had booby-trapped the corpses.

“[Fedoruk] is claiming that this has been a deliberate targeting by Russian soldiers – basically a massacre of civilians in his town,” said Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Lviv in western Ukraine.

Bucha has seen fierce fighting during the past few weeks and had been under Russian occupation for about a month until it was retaken this week.

“According to the mayor [the dead people] were trying to escape to Ukrainian held territory when, according to him, they were simply gunned down,” McBride said.

He said Ukraine’s ministry of defence has accused Russia of killing civilians in other towns.

“[The ministry] are saying that as they push forward, and the Russians are withdrawing, they are taking back territory, and it does appear as they do so that in places like Bucha and maybe in other towns there could well be more grisly discoveries waiting to be uncovered,” McBride said.

David DesRoches, a professor at the National Defense University in Washington, told Al Jazeera that the deliberate killing of civilians is a war crime.

“Placement of booby-traps and placement of mines are clear violations of the law of warfare, as well as deliberate targeting of civilians,” he said.

Brovary retaken

Ukrainian forces also recaptured the city of Brovary, 20km (12 miles) east of the capital, Mayor Ihor Sapozhko said in a televised Friday night address.

Shops were reopening and residents were returning but “still stand ready to defend” their city, he added.

“Russian occupants have now left practically all of the Brovary district,” Sapozhko said. “Tonight, [Ukrainian] armed forces will work to clear settlements of [remaining] occupants, military hardware, and possibly from mines.”

A prominent Ukrainian photojournalist who went missing last month in a combat zone near the capital was found dead on Friday in the Huta Mezhyhirska village north of Kyiv, the country’s prosecutor general’s office announced.

Maks Levin, 40, worked as a photojournalist and videographer for many Ukrainian and international publications.

The prosecutor general’s office attributed his death to two gunshots allegedly fired by the Russian military, and it said an investigation was under way.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/2/almost-300-buried-in-mass-grave-in-bucha-near-kyiv-mayor

Nearly 300 people have been buried in mass graves in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, just outside of Kyiv, the town's mayor said.

""In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves,"" Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP News Agency by phone. Fedoruk said the streets are ""littered with corpses,"" according to the news agency.

AFP journalists reported earlier on Saturday that they saw at least 20 bodies in civilian clothes laying on a single street in Bucha.

""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,"" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told Reuters, according to CNN.

—AFP News Agency (@AFP) April 2, 2022

The US embassy in Kyiv called the images from Bucha ""horrific.""

""The U.S. government is committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available. We can not stand quiet, the world needs to know what happened, and we all must act,"" the embassy said in a tweeted statement.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" and war crimes.

""Indeed, this is genocide,"" Zelenskyy said on Sunday. ""The elimination of the whole nation and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine we have over 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities.""

The European Union condemned ""atrocities"" by Russian forces following reports of mass casualties in Bucha.

""Shocked by news of atrocities committed by Russian forces. EU assists Ukraine in documenting war crimes,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted on Sunday. He added that the ""EU assists Ukraine in documenting war crimes"" and ""all cases must be pursued.""

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the International Criminal Court to visit Bucha ""to collect all the evidence of these war crimes,"" the Washington Post reported.

Russian forces have been trying to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv since the invasion began on February 24, but have been met with fierce resistance across the country. The death toll has been high on both sides, prompting the use of mass graves in other Ukrainian cities, such as Mariupol.

Last week, Russia's Defense Ministry announced that it would reduce its military assaults on Kyiv, although the United States has remained skeptical of those claims. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said on Saturday that the country had regained control of the ""whole Kyiv region,"" per AFP.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Saturday that retreating Russian troops were leaving mines around Ukrainian homes and ""even the bodies of those killed,"" creating a ""catastrophic"" situation for civilians, the Associated Press reported.

""It's still not possible to return to normal life, as it used to be, even at the territories that we are taking back after the fighting,"" Zelenskyy said, per AP. ""We need wait until our land is demined, wait till we are able to assure you that there won't be new shelling.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/nearly-300-people-buried-mass-grave-bucha-kyiv-mayor-says-2022-4

In one residential street, the bodies of at least 20 men in civilian clothes were found strewn over an area of several hundred yards.

Graphic videos and photos of that street and others in the community circulated online.

One showed a man’s body with his hands tied behind his back, and an open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground beside him. Another had a gaping head wound.

Two lay near bicycles and a third was next to an abandoned car. Some lay face up, with their limbs askew, while others were lying face down.

“In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves,” Fedoruk told news agency Agence France Presse. ""These are the consequences of Russian occupation.""

Ukrainian forces recaptured Bucha earlier this week, nearly a month after Russian forces alienated the town from the country's capital. Kyiv has been a major focus of Russian aggression and a military target since the start of the invasion in February, though Russia has been unable to capture the city.

The Russian defense ministry announced it was scaling back its military assaults on Kyiv last week. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukrainians that Russian forces believed to be leaving were placing land mines around Ukrainian homes.

""It's still not possible to return to normal life, as it used to be, even at the territories that we are taking back after the fighting,"" Zelensky said in his nightly message, according to the Associated Press.
