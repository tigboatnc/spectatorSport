A Russian cruise missile struck the Mykolaiv Regional State Administration building, leaving several missing and feared dead, but missed Vitaliy Kim, as he was at home asleep

A mayor in Ukraine was saved from being in a building destroyed by a Russian missile strike as he had overslept.

An administration building in Mykolaiv, a city in the south of the country near the Black Sea, was partly destroyed in the attack, leaving a large gaping hole in its centre.

Rescue workers are currently searching the rubble and debris for several people feared to have been inside at the time of the bombing.

Not among them was exhausted Head of Administration Vitaliy Kim, who had overslept and missed possibly a tragic fate.

Ukraine ’s Strategic Communications and Information Team tweeted: “Russian military shelled the Mykolaiv Regional State Administration building, head of the administration Vitaliy Kim says.

“According to Kim, several dozen people managed to leave the building.

“The rescue team is searching the rubble for 8 civilians and 3 servicemen. #StopRussia .”

A local news outlet added the building was destroyed in the missile strike but that head of administration was unhurt.

It added: “Vitaliy Kim says he was not in office, cause overslept.”

Mr Kim shared a still from CCTV showing the cruise missile, seconds before the explosion.

It comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russian troops are murdering officials in cities throughout the country

Speaking from Kyiv, he accused Moscow’s forces of kidnapping Mayors and then leaving them dead or missing.

Early in the war Ivan Federov, mayor of Melitopol, was abducted by Russian troops, sparking mass protests by Ukrainians.

Ten masked soldiers are said to have entered the town’s crisis centre, put a bag over his head and marched him away to an unknown location.

Days later Yevheniy Matvieyev, head of the southern town of Dniprorudne, was also abducted by Russian troops, leading to accusations made against Moscow of “systematic war crimes” by Ukraine’s military.

Zelensky said: “They are kidnapping the mayors of our cities. They killed some of them. We can’t find some of them.

“We have already found some of them and they are dead.”

The shocking claim comes amid fears Russian troops are compensating for their disastrous invasion by resorting to deliberately targeting civilians and executing officials.

Ahead of peace talks the Ukrainian leader said his country could declare neutrality and offer security guarantees to Russia to secure peace “without delay”.

Some 17,000 Russian troops have been killed in the invasion and 586 tanks blown up in ferocious fighting.

Moscow has also lost 123 warplanes and 127 helicopters to Ukraine’s ground defence systems.",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-mayor-survives-rocket-assassination-26580942

Romania’s health minister has said the country would distribute potassium iodine tablets free of charge to prepare in case of a nuclear emergency amid Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.

European countries have seen stocks of iodine fly off the shelves due to fears it may be needed to counter the risks of thyroid cancer if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes a nuclear incident.

Health Minister Alexandru Rafila said the government would start distributing the tablets from next week through family doctors though he warned they should not be taken preventively.

“They should be taken if there is a nuclear incident in the vicinity. Otherwise, they should not be taken,” he told reporters.

The ministry will also launch an information campaign to guide the population on how to obtain the pills, how to store them and how to administer them.

Rafila said a nuclear incident was “not probable” but “possible”.

“We cannot absolutely rule it out … We have to prepare for such a situation,” he said, adding the pills had a shelf-life of three years.

Several doctors have warned of the dangers of taking iodine without proper precautions, pointing at the serious side effects.

International health authorities say the tablets must be taken at precise times just before or after exposure with an incident occurring within a distance of some 20 kilometres.

They are recommended in particular for pregnant women, babies, children and young people.",https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-latest-developments-4-5723828-Mar2022/
3,2ff4f3a2-c45c-494d-9d2c-d2a4fd0408b3,"['Nebi Qena', 'Yuras Karmanau - Associated Press', 'Alexei Alexandrov - Stringer', 'Vadim Ghirda - Staff', 'Petros Giannakouris - Staff', 'Rodrigo Abd - Staff', 'Nariman El-Mofty - Staff', 'Uncredited - Hogp', 'Ukrainian Presidential Press Office', 'Turkish Presidency']",,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces bombarded areas around Kyiv and another city just hours after pledging to scale back operations in those zones to promote trust between the two sides, Ukrainian authorities said Wednesday.

The shelling — and intensified Russian attacks on other parts of the country — tempered optimism about any progress in the talks aimed at ending the punishing war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he stressed in a conversation with U.S. President Joe Biden that the war is at a “turning point"" and renewed his longstanding request for more help to resist the Russian invasion.

“If we really are fighting for freedom and in defense of democracy together, then we have a right to demand help in this difficult turning point. Tanks, aircraft, artillery systems. Freedom should be armed no worse than tyranny,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation, which he delivered standing in the dark outside the dimly lit presidential offices in Kyiv. He thanked the U.S. for an additional $500 million in aid that was announced Wednesday.

Meanwhile, talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to resume Friday by video, according to the head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arakhamia. But there seemed to be little faith that a resolution would emerge anytime soon. The Russian military reneged on its pledge Tuesday to de-escalate near the capital and the northern city of Chernihiv in order to “increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.”

The announcement was met with deep suspicion from Zelenskyy and the West. And soon after, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling hit homes, stores, libraries and other civilian sites in and around Chernihiv and on the outskirts of Kyiv. Russian troops also stepped up their attacks on the Donbas region in the east and around the city of Izyum, which lies on a key route to the Donbas, after redeploying units from other areas, the Ukrainian side said.

Olexander Lomako, secretary of the Chernihiv city council, said the Russian announcement turned out to be “a complete lie.”

“At night they didn’t decrease, but vice versa increased the intensity of military action,” Lomako said.

Five weeks into the invasion that has left thousands dead on both sides, the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country topped a staggering 4 million, half of them children, according to the United Nations.

“I do not know if we can still believe the Russians,” Nikolay Nazarov, a refugee from Ukraine, said as he pushed his father’s wheelchair at a border crossing into Poland. “I think more escalation will occur in eastern Ukraine. That is why we cannot go back to Kharkiv.”

Zelenskyy said the continuing negotiations with Russia were only “words without specifics.”

“We know that this is not a withdrawal but the consequences of being driven out,” Zelenskyy said of Russia's pledge. “But we also are seeing that Russia is now concentrating its forces for new strikes on Donbas, and we are preparing for this.”

Zelenskyy also said he had recalled Ukraine’s ambassadors to Georgia and Morocco, suggesting they had not done enough to persuade those countries to support Ukraine and punish Russia for the invasion.

“With all due respect, if there won’t be weapons, won’t be sanctions, won’t be restrictions for Russian business, then please look for other work,” he said.

In other developments:

—U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about the poor performance of his military in Ukraine because they are too afraid to tell him the truth.

—The German government said it received assurances from Russia that European companies won’t have to pay for Russian gas in rubles. That prospect had raised fears that Russia could cut them off. Also, Poland announced steps to end all Russian oil imports by the end of the year.

— The U.N. is looking into allegations that some residents of the besieged and shattered southern city of Mariupol have been forcibly taken to areas controlled by Russian forces or to Russia itself.

At a round of talks held Tuesday in Istanbul, the faint outlines of a possible peace agreement seemed to emerge when the Ukrainian delegation offered a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral — dropping its bid to join NATO, as Moscow has long demanded — in return for security guarantees from a group of other nations.

Top Russian officials responded positively, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saying Wednesday that Ukraine's willingness to accept neutrality and look outside NATO for security represents “significant progress,"" according to Russian news agencies.

But skepticism of statements from Russia by Zelenskyy and others seemed well-founded.

Oleksandr Pavliuk, head of the Kyiv region military administration, said Russian shells targeted residential areas and civilian infrastructure in the Bucha, Brovary and Vyshhorod regions around the capital.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the military also targeted fuel depots in two towns in central Ukraine with air-launched long-range cruise missiles. And Russian forces hit a Ukrainian special forces headquarters in the southern Mykolaiv region, he said, and two ammunition depots in the Donetsk region, which is part of the Donbas.

In southern Ukraine, a Russian missile destroyed a fuel depot in Dnipro, the country’s fourth-largest city, regional officials said.

The U.S. said that over the last 24 hours, Russia had begun to reposition less than 20% of its troops that had been arrayed around Kyiv.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that troops from there and some other zones have begun moving largely to the north, and some have gone into Belarus. Kirby said it appears Russia intends to resupply them and send them back into Ukraine, but it is not clear where.

The Ukrainian military said some Russian airborne units were recorded in neighboring Belarus and were believed to have withdrawn from Ukraine.

In northern Ukraine, Russian forces took no offensive actions Wednesday, focusing on reconnaissance and logistics, the general staff said in a statement. But Russia is expected to increase attacks soon on Ukrainian forces to protect its own troops as they are repositioned, it said.

The Russians also are expected to try to blockade Chernihiv.

Top Russian military officials have said in recent days that their main goal now is the “liberation” of Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial heartland where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. Western officials say Moscow is reinforcing its troops in the Donbas.

Some analysts have suggested that the focus on the Donbas and the pledge to de-escalate may merely be an effort to put a positive spin on reality: Moscow's ground forces have been thwarted — and have taken heavy losses — in their bid to seize the capital and other cities.

Meanwhile, a missile destroyed part of an apartment block in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk early Wednesday, and two people were reported killed. Separatists blamed Ukrainian forces for the attack.

“I was just sitting on the couch and — bang! — the window glass popped, the frames came off. I didn’t even understand what happened,” said resident Anna Gorda.

The U.N. food aid agency said it is providing emergency assistance to 1 million people in Ukraine. It said the food includes 330,000 freshly baked loaves of bread for families in the heavily bombarded eastern city of Kharkiv.

“Children are suffering, and our city, and everything,"" Tetyana Parmynska, a 28-year-old from the Chernihiv region now at a refugee center in Poland, said as man played songs on a battered piano decorated with a peace emblem. ""We have no strength anymore.”

4,2ff4f3a2-c45c-494d-9d2c-d2a4fd0408b3,"['Nebi Qena', 'Yuras Karmanau - Associated Press', 'Efrem Lukatsky - Staff', 'Felipe Dana - Staff', 'Petros Giannakouris - Staff', 'Rodrigo Abd - Staff', 'Nariman El-Mofty - Staff', 'Uncredited - Hogp', 'Ukrainian Presidential Press Office', 'Vadim Ghirda - Staff']",,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia announced Tuesday it will significantly scale back military operations near Ukraine’s capital and a northern city, as the outlines of a possible deal to end the grinding war came into view at the latest round of talks.

Ukraine's delegation at the conference, held in Istanbul, laid out a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations.

Moscow's public reaction was positive, and the negotiations are expected to resume Wednesday, five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country.

Amid the talks, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said Moscow has decided to “fundamentally ... cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv” to “increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.”

He did not immediately spell out what that would mean in practical terms.

The announcement was met with skepticism from the U.S. and others.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia cannot be trusted. Although the signals from the talks are ""positive,” they ”can’t silence explosions of Russian shells,” he said.

Zelenskyy said it was Ukrainian troops who forced Russia's hand, adding that “we shouldn’t ease our guard” because the invading army still ""has a great potential to continue attacks against our country.”

Ukraine will continue negotiations, he said, but officials do not trust the word of the country that continues ""fighting to destroy us.”

While Moscow portrayed it as a goodwill gesture, its ground troops have become bogged down and taken heavy losses in their bid to seize Kyiv and other cities. Last week and again on Tuesday, the Kremlin seemed to lower its war aims, saying its “main goal” now is gaining control of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

U.S. President Joe Biden, asked whether the Russian announcement was a sign of progress in the talks or an attempt by Moscow to buy time to continue its assault, said: “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention.”

Western officials say Moscow is reinforcing troops in the Donbas in a bid to encircle Ukraine’s forces. And Russia's deadly siege in the south continues, with civilians trapped in the ruins of Mariupol and other bombarded cities.

“There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter,” Blinken said in Morocco. “And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine.”

Even as negotiators gathered, Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces blasted a gaping hole in a nine-story government administration building in a strike on the southern port city of Mykolaiv, killing at least 12 people, emergency authorities said. The search for more bodies in the rubble continued.

“It’s terrible. They waited for people to go to work” before striking the building, said regional governor Vitaliy Kim. “I overslept. I’m lucky.”

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has detected small numbers of Russian ground forces moving away from the Kyiv area, but it appeared to be a repositioning of forces, “not a real withdrawal.”

He said it was too soon to say how extensive the Russian movements may be or where the troops will be repositioned.

“It does not mean the threat to Kyiv is over,” Kirby said. “They can still inflict massive brutality on the country, including on Kyiv.” He said Russian airstrikes against Kyiv continued.

Rob Lee, a military expert at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, tweeted of the Russian announcement: “This sounds like more of an acknowledgment of the situation around Kyiv where Russia’s advance has been stalled for weeks and Ukrainian forces have had recent successes. Russia doesn’t have the forces to encircle the city.”

The meeting in Istanbul was the first time negotiators from Russia and Ukraine talked face-to-face in two weeks. Earlier talks were held in person in Belarus or by video.

Among other things, the Kremlin has demanded all along that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO.

Ukraine’s delegation offered a detailed framework for a peace deal under which a neutral Ukraine's security would be guaranteed by a group of third countries, including the U.S., Britain, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to NATO’s ""an attack on one is an attack on all” principle.

Ukraine said it would also be willing to hold talks over a 15-year period on the future of the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Russia in 2014.

Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, said on Russian TV that the Ukrainian proposals are a “step to meet us halfway, a clearly positive fact.”

He cautioned that the parties are still far from reaching an agreement, but said: “We know now how to move further toward compromise. We aren’t just marking time in talks.”

In other developments:

— In what appeared to be a coordinated action to tackle Russian espionage, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland and North Macedonia expelled scores of Russian diplomats.

— The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency arrived in Ukraine to try to ensure the safety of the country’s nuclear facilities. Russian forces have taken control of the decommissioned Chernobyl plant, site in 1986 of the world’s worst nuclear accident, and of the active Zaporizhzhia plant, where a building was damaged in fighting.

— Russia has destroyed more than 60 religious buildings across the country in just over a month of war, with most of the damage concentrated near Kyiv and in the east, Ukraine’s military said.

— In the room at the Istanbul talks was Roman Abramovich, a longtime Putin ally who has been sanctioned by Britain and the European Union. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Chelsea soccer team owner has been serving as an unofficial mediator approved by both countries. But the mystery surrounding his role has been deepened by news reports that he may have been poisoned during an earlier round of talks.

Over the past several days, Ukrainian forces have mounted counterattacks and reclaimed ground on the outskirts of Kyiv and other areas.

Ukrainian soldiers gathered in a trench for photos with Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, who said that Ukraine had retaken control of a vast majority of Irpin, a key suburb northwest of the capital that has seen heavy fighting.

“We defend our motherland because we have very high morale,” said Syrskyi, the commander in charge of the defense of Kyiv. “And because we want to win.”

Ukrainian forces also took back Trostyanets, south of Sumy in the northeast, after weeks of occupation that left a landscape of Russian bodies, burned and twisted tanks and charred buildings.

Putin’s ground forces have been thwarted not just by stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, but by what Western officials say are Russian tactical missteps, poor morale, shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear, and other problems.

Repeating what the military said last week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday that “liberating Donbas” is now Moscow’s chief objective.

While that presents a possible face-saving exit strategy for Putin, it has also raised Ukrainian fears the Kremlin aims to split the country and force it to surrender a swath of its territory.

Elles ont produit un premier effet : l’armée d’invasion a assuré qu’elle allait relâcher sa pression sur les villes de Kyiv et Tchernihiv.

En résumé :

- Négociateurs ukrainiens et russes se retrouvent à Istanbul ce mardi. Des discussions qui marquent déjà quelques avancées : l’armée russe a assuré en début d’après-midi qu’elle allait relâcher sa pression sur les villes de Kyiv et Tchernihiv.

- Des mercenaires russes du groupe Wagner seraient déployés dans l’est de l’Ukraine, où la Russie dit désormais concentrer ses efforts. Plus de 1 000 combattants de la sulfureuse société paramilitaire pourraient se trouver sur le champ de bataille, selon les renseignements britanniques.

- Les autorités ukrainiennes s’inquiètent de l’aggravation de la situation dans le port assiégé de Marioupol, où au moins 5 000 personnes auraient déjà péri. L’armée russe tente de s’en emparer depuis fin février, et environ 160 000 personnes y sont toujours coincées, selon son maire.

Washington évoque un «repositionnement» des forces russes près de Kyiv, mais «pas un vrai retrait». Les forces russes autour de Kiev ont entamé un «repositionnement» mais «pas un vrai retrait», a affirmé mardi le porte-parole du ministère américain de la Défense, John Kirby. «Nous pouvons confirmer que nous avons vu un petit nombre» de troupes «commencer à se repositionner», a-t-il dit devant la presse. Mais «nous devons être prêts à voir une offensive majeure contre d’autres zones d’Ukraine» et «cela ne signifie pas que la menace contre Kyiv soit terminée», a-t-il prévenu. « Nous devons être lucides sur la réalité de ce qui se passe sur le terrain et personne ne devrait être dupe des annonces de la Russie », a affirmé de son côté Kate Bedingfield, une porte-parole de la Maison Blanche.

Biden attend de voir si la Russie «tient parole» sur une désescalade. Joe Biden a déclaré mardi que les Occidentaux attendaient de voir si la Russie «tenait parole» sur la réduction de son activité militaire en direction de Kiev et Tcherniguiv, en Ukraine. «On verra s’ils tiennent parole», a dit le président américain à des journalistes, peu après s’être entretenu avec les dirigeants français, britannique, allemand et italien. «Il semble y avoir un consensus sur le fait qu’il faut voir ce qu’ils ont à offrir».

Biden et les alliés européens d’accord pour «continuer d’accroître le coût payé par la Russie». Joe Biden et plusieurs dirigeants européens ont convenu mardi lors d’un appel téléphonique de continuer à sanctionner Moscou pour son invasion de l’Ukraine, a annoncé la Maison Blanche. «Les dirigeants ont affirmé leur détermination à continuer d’accroître le coût payé par la Russie pour son attaque brutale de l’Ukraine, ainsi que de continuer à apporter une aide sécuritaire à l’Ukraine pour qu’elle se défende», selon un communiqué publié après l’échange entre le président américain et ses homologues français, britannique, allemand et italien.

Une opération humanitaire à Marioupol pas possible «à ce stade» selon l’Elysée. Les conditions pour lancer dans les prochains jours une opération humanitaire au secours des habitants de la ville ukrainienne de Marioupol, assiégée par l’armée russe, ne «sont pas réunies à ce stade», a annoncé l’Elysée après un entretien entre les présidents Emmanuel Macron et Vladimir Poutine. Le chef de l’Etat français a présenté cette opération d’évacuation - proposée par la France, la Turquie et la Grèce - à son homologue russe qui a dit «qu’il allait y réfléchir» avant de donner une réponse, a ajouté la présidence.

Les «nationalistes» ukrainiens à Marioupol doivent «déposer les armes», affirme Poutine. Le président russe Vladimir Poutine a affirmé mardi que les forces ukrainiennes défendant le port stratégique de Marioupol, assiégé depuis des semaines par les troupes de Moscou, doivent se rendre pour permettre de venir en aide aux civils sur place. « Pour trouver une solution à la situation humanitaire difficile dans cette ville, les combattants nationalistes ukrainiens doivent arrêter de résister et déposer les armes », a indiqué Poutine, selon un communiqué du Kremlin résumant un échange téléphonique avec son homologue français Emmanuel Macron.

Biden et quatre dirigeants européens mettent en garde contre tout «relâchement de la détermination occidentale».Les dirigeants britannique, américain, français, allemand et italien ont mis en garde mardi, lors d’une conversation téléphonique, contre tout «relâchement de la détermination occidentale» face à l’invasion russe de l’Ukraine, selon Downing Street. Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz et Mario Draghi «sont convenus qu’il ne pouvait y avoir aucun relâchement de la détermination occidentale tant que l’horreur infligée à l’Ukraine ne serait pas terminée», a indiqué un porte-parole du Premier ministre britannique dans un communiqué.

Roman Abramovitch, d’oligarque à négociateur secret. Propriétaire du Chelsea FC, le ténébreux milliardaire russe, victime d’un possible empoisonnement, était présent à Istanbul lors de l’ouverture des négociations entre l’Ukraine et la Russie. Son rôle reste encore flou dans cette opaque diplomatie parallèle. Un récit à lire ici.

Plus que «des paroles», Londres attend «des actes» de Moscou. Le gouvernement britannique a averti mardi la Russie qu’il la jugerait «sur ses actes, pas ses paroles» après l’annonce par Moscou d’une réduction «radicale» de ses activités militaires en direction de Kyiv et Tcherniguiv, dans le nord-est de l’Ukraine.

Le coup de fil entre Macron et Poutine toujours en cours. L’entretien téléphonique entre Emmanuel Macron et Vladimir Poutine est «en cours», a annoncé mardi l’Elysée, au moment où Washington et Londres ont exprimé des doutes sur l’annonce d’avancées dans les discussions entre Kiev et Moscou à Istanbul. Le président français Emmanuel Macron avait auparavant déclaré qu’il voulait discuter avec son homologue russe «pour sécuriser l’opération humanitaire à Marioupol», précisant que l’objectif était de la lancer «dans les prochains jours», en reprochant à la Russie un «non-respect du droit humanitaire international».

Le club de Bath va envoyer neuf rugbymen en Pologne. Bon dernier du championnat anglais du rugby, le club de Bath a décidé de s’engager à sa manière pour aider les victimes ukrainiennes de la guerre. Mercredi, les habitants de la petite ville du sud-ouest de l’Angleterre seront invités à donner des sacs de couchage, des vêtements et des jouets pour les personnes ayant fui l’Ukraine. Trois fourgonnettes seront ainsi positionnées devant les locaux du club pour réceptionner le tout. Une fois la collecte terminée neuf joueurs de l’équipe, dont la star Tom Ellis transporteront l’ensemble des dons, eux-mêmes, en Pologne où transitent de nombreux réfugiés. Soit un aller-retour de plus de 3 000 kilomètres. We are asking for donations to be delivered to those affected by the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦

La Russie n’a pas convaincu la Maison Blanche. Les Etats-Unis doutent encore du «réel sérieux» de la Russie dans les négociations avec l’Ukraine, a affirmé mardi le secrétaire d’Etat américain Antony Blinken après l’annonce d’avancées dans les discussions entre Kiev et Moscou à Istanbul. «Je n’ai rien vu qui puisse suggérer qu’il y a un véritable mouvement parce que nous n’avons pas vu de signes de réel sérieux de la part de la Russie», a déclaré le chef de la diplomatie américaine en visite au Maroc, lors d’une conférence de presse. «Mais si l’Ukraine considère qu’il y en a [du mouvement], c’est bien et nous soutiendrons cela», a toutefois nuancé le diplomate américain.

L’Irlande expulse quatre diplomates russes. Après les Pays-Bas et la Belgique, l’Irlande a annoncé elle aussi mardi expulser quatre diplomates russes expliquant que leurs activités «ne correspondent pas aux standards internationaux du comportement diplomatique». L’ambassadeur russe à Dublin a été convoqué au ministère des Affaires étrangères pour se voir signifier ces expulsions, a précisé la diplomatie irlandaise dans un communiqué, précisant vouloir «garder ouverts les canaux diplomatiques» avec Moscou dans le contexte de l’invasion russe en Ukraine.

Le ferry «Méditerranée» accueille ses premiers réfugiés. De bateau de croisière à hôtel flottant pour réfugiés ukrainiens. Le ferry de la compagnie Corsica linea reconverti en centre d’hébergement doit accueillir ses premiers réfugiés ce mardi. Selon le projet de la région Provence-Alpes-Cote-d’Azur et de la compagnie, le bateau qui durant des années reliait Marseille à Alger, «1 700 réfugiés pourraient ainsi être logés et nourris à bord du ferry», estiment le président de la Région Renaud Muselier et le DG de Corsica Linea Pierre-Antoine Villanova dans une lettre adressée à Emmanuel Macron. Une capacité qui pourrait être portée à 3 000 réfugiés dès septembre 2022 avec l’ajout d’un second ferry ajoutent-ils.

Les Pays-Bas expulsent 17 Russes accusés d’espionnage. Les Pays-Bas vont expulser 17 officiers de renseignement russes qui s’adonnaient «secrètement» à des activités d’espionnage, a indiqué mardi le ministère des Affaires étrangères néerlandais. La Haye a pris cette décision sur la base d’informations des services de renseignement néerlandais selon lesquelles les personnes concernées, «accréditées en tant que diplomates auprès des représentations russes aux Pays-Bas, sont secrètement actives en tant qu’officiers de renseignement», a déclaré le ministère dans un communiqué. Dans le même temps, la Belgique a décidé, elle, d’expulser 21 Russes accusés eux-aussi d’espionnage.

Le patriarche orthodoxe de Constantinople témoigne sa solidarité aux Ukrainiens. Bartholomée, le patriarche orthodoxe de Constantinople a rencontré mardi à Varsovie des réfugiés ukrainiens pour leur témoigner sa solidarité et dénoncer l’agression russe contre leur pays. Dans un discours à l’université catholique Stefan Wyszynski, il a qualifié «d’inimaginables» les destructions causées «par cette invasion horrible, dans la nation ukrainienne et dans le monde entier». «Si toute guerre mérite condamnation, une guerre entre orthodoxes est absolument inacceptable», a dit le dignitaire religieux de 82 ans venu dans une église orthodoxe à Varsovie pour prier pour la paix, avant de déplorer «la crise d’unité» traversée actuellement par les chrétiens orthodoxes.

Londres saisit un yacht russe en représailles à la guerre en Ukraine. Oh la belle prise ! Un yacht de luxe avec piscine et cave à vin appartenant à un ressortissant russe a été saisi à Londres dans le cadre des représailles à l’invasion russe en Ukraine, a annoncé mardi l’agence britannique de lutte contre la criminalité (NCA). Une fois l’identité du propriétaire établie - un homme d’affaires russe dont le nom n’a pas été révélé -, l’information a été transmise au ministre des Transports Grant Shapps, qui a ordonné mardi la «première saisie d’un superyacht dans les eaux britanniques jamais réalisée», selon un communiqué de la NCA. Pas mécontent de la saisie, le ministre a publié sur Twitter une photo de lui posant devant le Phi, troisième plus grand yacht construit par les chantiers navals néerlandais Royal Huisman, avec 58 mètres de long, d’une valeur de 38 millions de livres sterling (45 millions d’euros). 🚨BREAKING: Russian superyacht detained.

Nouvelles discussions entre Joe Biden et plusieurs dirigeants européens. Le président américain Joe Biden doit s’entretenir avec les dirigeants français, britannique, allemand et italien ce mardi après-midi à propos de la guerre en Ukraine. Concrètement, cet échange vise à «discuter des derniers développements concernant l’invasion russe de l’Ukraine», a précisé un porte-parole de la Maison Blanche alors le chef de la délégation russe, Vladimir Medinski, a qualifié les pourparlers du jour entre Russes et Ukrainiens de «discussions substantielles».

Pour Kyiv, les conditions sont réunies pour une rencontre Poutine-Zelensky. Les conditions pour une première rencontre entre le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky et son homologue russe Vladimir Poutine sont désormais «suffisantes» après la nouvelle session de pourparlers russo-ukrainiens ce mardi en Turquie, affirme le négociateur en chef ukrainien. «Les résultats de la réunion d’aujourd’hui (à Istanbul) sont suffisants pour une rencontre au niveau des chefs d’Etat», déclare David Arakhamia. Depuis le début du conflit, Moscou a toujours refusé une telle proposition de Kyiv.

Kiev acceptera la neutralité si elle obtient un «accord international» garantissant sa sécurité. Alors que la question de son éventuelle neutralité est au cœur des négociations en cours à Istanbul, l’Ukraine veut voir sa sécurité garantie par un «accord international», dont seraient signataires plusieurs pays garants. «Nous insistons pour qu’il s’agisse d’un accord international qui sera signé par tous les garants de la sécurité, déclare ce mardi après-midi David Arakhamia, le négociateur en chef ukrainien après plusieurs heures de pourparlers. Nous voulons un mécanisme international de garanties de sécurité où les pays garants agiront de façon analogue au chapitre 5 de l’Otan et même de façon plus ferme», ajoute-t-il.

L’armée russe annonce relâcher la pression sur Kyiv et Tchernihiv. La Russie va radicalement réduire son activité militaire en direction de Kyiv et Tchernihiv en Ukraine, après des pourparlers russo-ukrainiens «substantiels» à Istanbul, ont indiqué mardi des négociateurs russes. «Les négociations sur un accord sur la neutralité et le statut non-nucléaire de l’Ukraine entrant dans une dimension pratique […], il a été décidé, pour accroître la confiance, de réduire radicalement l’activité militaire en direction de Kyiv et Tchernihiv», a déclaré à Istanbul le vice-ministre russe de la Défense, Alexandre Fomine. Le chef de la délégation russe, Vladimir Medinski, a, lui, fait état de «discussions substantielles». Infographie : la situation en Ukraine au 28 mars. (Alice Clair/Julien Guillot)

L’armée russe a atteint ses cibles et va se concentrer sur le Donbass, selon le ministre russe de la Défense. Son absence d’apparition publique depuis des jours avait entraîné des rumeurs sur son état de santé et ses liens réels avec le président russe Vladimir Poutine. Après une intervention samedi, le ministre de la Défense russe Sergueï Choïgou a une nouvelle fois pris la parole ce mardi. Il a assuré que Moscou allait désormais se concentrer sur la «libération» de la région du Donbass. «Le potentiel de combat des forces armées ukrainiennes a été considérablement réduit, ce qui nous permet de concentrer notre attention et nos principaux efforts sur la réalisation de l’objectif principal, c’est-à-dire la libération du Donbass», a déclaré Choïgou, selon des propos rapportés par l’agence russe Interfax. Le ministre de Défense a ajouté qu’une «assistance humanitaire» était apportée par la Russie aux territoires séparatistes de Louhansk et Donetsk. «Pas moins de 684 opérations humanitaires ont été réalisées, et 6 079 tonnes de marchandises ont été fournies à 210 localités peuplées», a précisé Choïgou. Le ministère russe a par ailleurs annoncé réduire «radicalement» son activité militaire dans les régions de Kyiv et Tcherniguiv en Ukraine.

Au moins 7 morts et 22 blessés dans la frappe russe à Mykolaïv, selon Zelensky. Le bombardement qui a touché le bâtiment de l’administration régional à Mykolaïv a causé la mort de sept personnes, a déclaré le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky. Plus tôt dans la journée, le gouverneur de la ville Vitaly Kim a assuré que huit civils et trois militaires étaient recherchés dans les décombres. «Il n’y avait pas de visées militaires à Mykolaïv, les habitants de Mykolaïv ne présentaient aucune menace contre la Russie. Et malgré cela, comme tous les Ukrainiens, ils sont devenus les cibles des troupes russes», a affirmé Zelensky devant le Parlement danois.

Selon Zelensky, les attaques russes contre Marioupol sont un «crime contre l’humanité». Lors d’un discours devant le Parlement danois, le président ukrainien a dénoncé les bombardements russes sur la ville du sud-est du pays. «Ce que les troupes russes font à Marioupol est un crime contre l’humanité, qui se déroule en direct sous les yeux de la planète», a dit Zelensky lors d’une intervention en visioconférence, accusant la Russie de bombarder volontairement les abris des civils dans cette ville assiégée.

L’enseigne de sports française Decathlon «suspend» ses activités en Russie. Si Decathlon a fermé ses quatre magasins en banlieue de Kyiv, la marque française ne prévoyait pas de tirer le rideau de ses boutiques en Russie. Sous pression, Decathlon effectue pourtant un rétropédalage en raison de problèmes d’approvisionnement. «Respectant scrupuleusement les sanctions internationales, Decathlon constate que les conditions d’approvisionnement ne sont plus réunies pour poursuivre son activité en Russie. Decathlon est amené à suspendre l’exploitation de ses magasins», écrit dans son communiqué l’enseigne de la galaxie Mulliez, qui a jusque-là maintenu en Russie les activités de ses marques Auchan et Leroy-Merlin. Contrairement à ces deux magasins français, Decathlon est moins implanté en Russie.

Le Kremlin souhaite que ses exportations de gaz russe soient payées en roubles. Le gouvernement russe insiste ce mardi sur le paiement en roubles du gaz russe livré à l’Europe, rejetant les critiques du G7, alors que les Occidentaux et les Russes multiplient les sanctions et contre-sanctions depuis le début de la guerre en Ukraine. «Personne ne va livrer de gaz gratuitement. C’est tout simplement impossible. Et on ne peut le payer qu’en roubles», a déclaré le porte-parole du Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov. «La situation a changé dans le contexte d’une guerre économique menée contre la Russie», a-t-il encore souligné, «les entreprises [commandant du gaz russe] doivent [le] comprendre». La semaine dernière, le président Vladimir Poutine annonçait que la Russie n’accepterait plus que des roubles en paiement des livraisons de gaz à l’UE, donnant une semaine aux autorités russes pour élaborer un nouveau système de règlement. Lundi, les pays du G7 ont estimé qu’exiger un paiement en roubles du gaz russe n’était «pas acceptable», selon une annonce faite par le ministre allemand de l’Economie Robert Habeck, qui a appelé les entreprises concernées à «ne pas répondre à la demande de Poutine» et qualifié la Russie de «fournisseur pas fiable».

Selon le Kremlin, Poutine a le «soutien absolu» de sa population. Citant un nouveau sondage, le gouvernement russe estime que la population soutient largement leur président Vladimir Poutine. Il y aurait même eu une «croissance sans précédent» du soutien au dirigeant russe. La véracité de l’enquête est évidemment à remettre en question et l’on peut aisément suggérer qu’elle a été fabriquée à des fins de propagande. Russes, votre soutien passif au régime est intenable, arrêtez Poutine! Europe 4 mars 2022

Pas d’excuses pour les propos controversés de Biden. Le président américain Joe Biden a soutenu lundi soir qu’il ne retirerait pas ses propos controversés suggérant qu’il souhaitait le départ de son homologue russe Vladimir Poutine du pouvoir, car ils exprimaient son «indignation» personnelle et pas une «politique» en faveur d’un changement de régime. «Je ne les retire pas» et «je ne m’excuse pas», a encore déclaré Joe Biden devant la presse. «Les actes de cet homme, c’est juste de la brutalité», a-t-il martelé, avant de tenter de clarifier sa position : «Personne ne croit que je parlais de renverser Poutine». C’est samedi soir, en déplacement à Varsovie, que le président américain a semé le trouble en lançant au sujet de Vladimir Poutine : «Pour l’amour de Dieu, cet homme ne peut pas rester au pouvoir !» Cette petite phrase qui ne figurait pas dans le texte écrit du discours a contraint la Maison Blanche à tenter immédiatement de minimiser sa portée. Plusieurs experts et dirigeants de pays alliés des Etats-Unis ont estimé que cette déclaration allait à l’encontre des efforts des Occidentaux pour ne pas justifier une escalade russe dans la guerre menée par Moscou en Ukraine.

Les accusations sur l’empoisonnement de Roman Abramovitch font partie de la guerre de l’information, selon le Kremlin. Le Wall Street Journal rapportait lundi que l’oligarque russe proche de Vladimir Poutine aurait présenté des signes d’empoisonnement. Selon le porte-parole du Kremlin Dmitri Peskov cet empoisonnement présumé «fait partie de la campagne d’information, du sabotage de l’information, de la guerre de l’information». «Ces rapports [concernant un éventuel empoisonnement, ndlr] ne sont certainement pas vrais», a-t-il ajouté lors d’un point presse. Le Kremlin affirme également que Roman Abramovitch n’est pas un membre officiel de la délégation russe en Turquie. D’après Peskov, il serait seulement chargé d’assurer «certains contacts» entre Moscou et Kyiv. Le milliardaire a été photographié à Istanbul, dans le palais de Dolmabahçe, où se tiennent les pourparlers. Selon une journaliste du Guardian présente en Turquie pour assister aux négociations, Roman Abramovitch et le député ukrainien Rustem Umerov auraient organisé une série de discussions entre eux dans des hôtels d’Istanbul. De quoi laisser suggérer à certains la piste de négociations parallèles.

Emmanuel Macron et Vladimir Poutine vont s’entretenir par téléphone ce mardi après-midi. Le président français et son homologue russe vont à nouveau échanger ce mardi, selon l’Elysée. Il s’agira du dixième coup de fil entre Macron et Poutine depuis leur rencontre physique, le 7 février, à Moscou. Le dernier échange au téléphone remonte au 12 mars. L’objectif principal était alors d’évoquer l’urgence d’un cessez-le-feu. Il s’agissait pour l’Elysée de mettre «le président Poutine au pied du mur du respect de ses engagements».

La France se prépare à d’éventuelles coupures de gaz. Pour faire face à une éventuelle interruption de l’approvisionnement de gaz russe l’hiver prochain, la France se prépare à des coupures ciblées chez certains gros consommateurs. «On attend la sortie d’un décret délestage, que le gouvernement doit sortir ces prochains jours», a indiqué lors d’une conférence de presse Laurence Poirier-Dietz, la directrice générale de GRDF, le réseau de distribution de gaz. Les particuliers ne seront pas touchés, a-t-elle précisé, indiquant toutefois qu’ils pouvaient tout de même réaliser des économies d’énergie. De son côté, le ministère de la Transition écologique a évoqué «un dispositif de dernier ressort» et apporté les précisions suivantes : «Le projet de décret vise à préciser l’organisation du délestage de la consommation de gaz naturel, c’est-à-dire la suppression momentanée et planifiée de la fourniture de gaz naturel à certains consommateurs».

Le directeur de l’Agence internationale de l’énergie atomique en Ukraine. Le compte Twitter de l’International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a publié ce mardi une photo du directeur de l’agence, l’Argentin Rafael Mariano Grossi, présent en Ukraine. Son rôle, précise l’agence, est de «fournir une assistance technique urgente pour assurer la sûreté et la sécurité des installations nucléaires du pays» et «aider à prévenir le risque d’accident qui pourrait mettre en danger les personnes et l’environnement». Depuis le début de l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie, le 24 février, la sûreté des centrales nucléaires ukrainiennes inquiète. Ainsi de l’attaque menée par la Russie contre un bâtiment de la centrale de Zaporijia, l’une des quatre centrales ukrainiennes, dans la nuit du 3 au 4 mars.

Au moins deux morts après la frappe russe à Mykolaïv, selon un premier bilan. Le bâtiment de l’administration régionale a été touché par un bombardement russe, ce mardi, selon le gouverneur Vitaly Kim. «Je prenais le petit-déjeuner dans mon appartement. J’ai entendu un sifflement, puis un boum et ma fenêtre a été soufflée», a raconté à l’Agence France-Presse Donald, un Canadien de 69 ans à la retraite et résidant en Ukraine. «C’est effrayant. Nous avons eu de la chance ici, à Mykolaïv, nous n’avons pas eu autant d’explosions dans le centre de la ville» que dans d’autres villes, a-t-il ajouté.

Les noms et adresses de centaines d’agents des services de renseignement russes dévoilés. Selon The Times, une liste de 620 personnes, qui seraient des agents du FSB [le service de renseignement russe, ndlr], a été publiée lundi par l’agence de renseignement de la défense ukrainienne. Kyiv a déclaré de son côté qu’il s’agissait d’une violation des données de l’agence de sécurité russe. Selon la direction ukrainienne des services de renseignement, la liste comprend les données personnelles d’agents engagés dans des «activités criminelles» à travers l’Europe. Outre les noms et les adresses, la liste comprend des informations sur les voitures des agents, telles que les plaques d’immatriculation, les numéros de téléphone et les dates et lieux de naissance. Toutes les personnes figurant sur la liste sont enregistrées comme vivant à la Loubianka, le siège du FSB à Moscou. Selon la liste, un agent utilisait dans son adresse Skype l’expression «jamesbond007». Depuis le début de l’invasion de l’Ukraine, le 24 février, la Russie a subi plusieurs piratages. Le groupe de hackers Anonymous a revendiqué certaines de ces fuites.

L’oligarque russe Roman Abramovitch présent en Turquie pour les négociations. Son visage est apparu parmi les délégations russes et ukrainiennes accueillies à Istanbul par le président turc Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Le milliardaire Roman Abramovitch, proche de Vladimir Poutine, fait partie des émissaires du président russe. Selon le Wall Street Journal, l’homme d’affaires et propriétaire du Chelsea FC transite depuis le début de la guerre entre la capitale ukrainienne, Moscou, Lviv et d’autres lieux de négociation. Toujours selon le quotidien américain, Abramovitch aurait été empoisonné à Kyiv au début du mois. Trois membres de la délégation participant aux pourparlers de paix entre l’Ukraine et la Russie dans la nuit du 3 au 4 mars ont également présenté des symptômes compatibles avec un empoisonnement aux armes chimiques, a rapporté le média d’investigation Bellingcat.

Une frappe russe a touché le siège de l’administration régionale de Mykolaïv, selon le gouverneur de la ville. «Le bâtiment de l’administration régionale touché», a écrit sur Facebook Vitaly Kim, le gouverneur de la région de Mykolaïv, une ville proche d’Odessa. La plupart des personnes se trouvant à l’intérieur seraient indemnes. «On cherche huit civils et trois militaires», a précisé le gouverneur. Sur Telegram, Vitaly Kim a déclaré que les Russes «ont attendu que les gens se rendent au travail pour frapper» le bâtiment. La plupart des personnes avaient été évacuées du bâtiment selon lui. «Ils [les Russes] ont compris qu’ils ne pouvaient pas prendre cette ville et ont décidé de m’envoyer - ou de tous nous envoyer - un salut», a également déclaré le gouverneur, selon une journaliste du Washington Post.

A Tchernobyl, l’armée russe a traversé la zone sans protection. Des travailleurs du site où s’est produite la catastrophe nucléaire en 1986 ont déclaré à Reuters que des soldats russes ont conduit leurs véhicules blindés sans protection contre les radiations dans une zone hautement toxique appelée «Forêt rouge», soulevant des nuages de poussière radioactive sur leur passage. «Le convoi a soulevé une grande colonne de poussière, a rapporté un travailleur du site à l’agence de presse. De nombreux capteurs de radioprotection ont affiché des niveaux dépassés.» Un geste «suicidaire», selon un employé du site, car la poussière radioactive inhalée par les soldats russes était susceptible de provoquer des radiations internes dans leur corps. De son côté, Moscou a nié que ses forces aient mis en danger des installations nucléaires en Ukraine. L’armée russe s’était emparée du site dès le premier jour de l’invasion de l’Ukraine, le 24 février. Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster drove their armored vehicles without radiation protection through a highly toxic zone called the ‘Red Forest,’ kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, workers at the site said https://t.co/Cn342E9E33 pic.twitter.com/tMdVRE3EGw — Reuters (@Reuters) March 29, 2022

Les évacuations de civils via les couloirs humanitaires reprennent. L’Ukraine a annoncé ce mardi une reprise des évacuations de civils via trois couloirs humanitaires, notamment depuis la ville assiégée de Marioupol, après une journée de suspension par crainte de «provocations» russes. «Trois couloirs humanitaires ont été validés pour aujourd’hui», a ainsi déclaré la vice-Première ministre ukrainienne Iryna Verechtchouk dans une vidéo diffusée sur Telegram.

Les Etats-Unis veulent affaiblir encore davantage la machine de guerre russe. Après avoir déjà sanctionné l’industrie de défense de la Russie, Washington envisage de viser d’autres secteurs participant à l’effort de guerre mené par le Kremlin en Ukraine, a indiqué mardi un responsable du ministère américain de l’Economie. L’idée est de «saper la capacité de la Russie à construire et à entretenir [ses] outils de guerre», a expliqué Wally Adeyemo. «En plus de sanctionner les entreprises dans les secteurs qui permettent les activités malveillantes du Kremlin, nous prévoyons également de prendre des mesures pour perturber leurs chaînes d’approvisionnement», a-t-il détaillé. Depuis le début de l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie, les Etats-Unis de Joe Biden ont déjà dégainé une série de sanctions économiques et financières visant l’économie russe ainsi que les oligarques proches de Vladimir Poutine.

Pour le président turc Erdogan, la Russie et l’Ukraine ont toutes deux «des préoccupations légitimes». Alors que des pourparlers se poursuivent ce mardi à Istanbul, en Turquie, le président turc Recep Tayyip Erdogan a déclaré ce mardi en accueillant les délégations de négociateurs que les deux pays ont «des préoccupations légitimes». Selon lui, l’Ukraine et la Russie doivent «mettre un terme à cette tragédie» qu’est la guerre en Ukraine. Les pourparlers entre les deux délégations doivent commencer après cette réception, dans le palais de Dolmabahçe à Istanbul où la présidence turque dispose de bureaux.

La difficile évaluation de la responsabilité de crimes de guerre. A mesure que les frappes contre les civils s’accumulent en Ukraine, et que Moscou renvoie la responsabilité sur Kyiv, journalistes, ONG et instances internationales entreprennent le difficile travail d’attribution de ces crimes de guerre, pour en juger les responsables. Un travail fastidieux et perturbé par la guerre informationnelle à laquelle se livrent les deux camps. «Il faut combiner les témoignages de témoins et de victimes, analyser les images satellites, les photos prises de l’attaque, les débris des armes utilisées qu’on peut avoir ou encore la forme du cratère», explique ainsi à Libération Marc Garlasco, conseiller militaire à PAX, une ONG hollandaise.

Des civils ukrainiens enlevés par la Russie ? Une ONG ukrainienne de défense des droits de l’homme, Zmina, affirme que «des dizaines de civils ont été enlevés et des milliers d’autres déportés vers la Russie» depuis le début de l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie. «Où sont-ils emmenés», interpelle l’ONG sur les réseaux sociaux. L’affirmation a été reprise par plusieurs autorités britanniques, dont la ministre des Affaires étrangères, Liz Truss. Sur Twitter, elle a accusé le président russe Vladimir Poutine de recourir à la «tactique odieuse» de l’enlèvement de civils ukrainiens. Selon elle, Poutine a «recours à des mesures désespérées». Le représentant permanent adjoint du Royaume-Uni auprès des Nations Unies, à New York, James Kariuki, a également réagi. «Poutine ne peut pas prendre l’Ukraine, alors il prend son peuple, a écrit le diplomate sur Twitter. Des dizaines de civils ont été enlevés et des milliers d’autres déportés vers la Russie. Ces crimes ont des noms et des visages.» Putin continues to use abhorrent tactics against the Ukrainian people, including abducting innocent civilians.



He is not achieving his objectives and is resorting to desperate measures.

Le ministre ukrainien des Affaires étrangères appelle à criminaliser l’utilisation du symbole «Z» comme moyen de soutien à la Russie. D’abord apparue sur les véhicules militaires de l’armée russe présents en Ukraine, la lettre «Z» est devenue sur les réseaux sociaux ou lors de rassemblements un signe de ralliement à l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie. Face à ce symbole, plusieurs autorités réclament la criminalisation de son utilisation, à l’instar du ministre ukrainien des Affaires étrangères, Dmytro Kuleba. «Je demande à tous les États de criminaliser l’utilisation du symbole «Z» comme moyen de soutenir publiquement la guerre d’agression de la Russie contre l’Ukraine, a-t-il écrit sur Twitter ce mardi. «Z» signifie crimes de guerre russes, villes bombardées, milliers d’Ukrainiens assassinés. Le soutien public à cette barbarie doit être interdit.» En Allemagne, plusieurs autorités fédérales ont déjà annoncé qu’elles allaient sanctionner l’utilisation du symbole.

L’orthodoxie, bras armé du nationalisme de Poutine en Ukraine. Le patriarche de Moscou, Kirill, le chef de la puissante Eglise orthodoxe russe, affiche ses positions pro-Kremlin et défend l’invasion de l’Ukraine. «Les origines de la confrontation sont à trouver dans la relation entre l’Occident et la Russie», écrit-il ainsi dans une lettre rendue publique le 10 mars et adressée au Conseil œcuménique des Eglises, en Suisse. Le patriarche s’en prend aussi à la «tentative de transformation mentale des Ukrainiens et des Russes vivant en Ukraine en ennemis de la Russie». Un soutien prononcé à Vladimir Poutine, qui creuse les divergences fratricides dans le monde orthodoxe et risque de fragiliser le patriarcat de Moscou. Lire notre analyse.

La progression de l’armée russe bloquée sur plusieurs fronts. L’état-major ukrainien a affirmé dans la nuit de lundi à mardi que ses troupes avaient «bloqué la progression de l’ennemi dans la région de Tchernigiv», au nord de Kyiv. Un responsable américain de la défense a indiqué de son côté que les Russes étaient «statiques» autour de Kyiv, la capitale. Dans les régions de Tchernigiv, Soumy, Kharkiv, du Donbass, et dans le sud de l’Ukraine, «la situation reste partout tendue, très difficile», a-t-il ajouté. Autour de Kharkiv, la deuxième ville d’Ukraine, des combats acharnés font toujours rage. Mais des soldats ukrainiens ont annoncé avoir repris le contrôle de Mala Rogan, un petit village à environ quatre kilomètres de la ville. Dans le sud, l’étau russe se desserre aussi autour de certaines villes, comme Mykolaïv, une ville verrou sur la route d’Odessa, le plus grand port d’Ukraine. L’armée ukrainienne a également mené une contre-offensive ukrainienne sur Kherson, la seule ville d’importance dont l’armée russe a revendiqué la prise totale depuis son invasion le 24 février.

De nouvelles tractations débutent à Istanbul. Les négociateurs russes sont arrivés lundi à Istanbul, où une précédente séance de négociations avait déjà eu lieu le 10 mars mais n’avait débouché sur aucune avancée. Le ministre ukrainien des Affaires étrangères Dmytro Kouleba a indiqué par la suite que son président Volodymyr Zelensky avait «donné des instructions très claires à notre délégation. Nous ne marchandons pas les personnes, ni territoire ou la souveraineté». D’après lui, l’objectif a minima des discussions en Turquie est de résoudre les problèmes humanitaires et le but ultime est de décrocher un cessez-le-feu stable. Le porte-parole du Kremlin Dmitri Peskov a cependant tempéré les attentes lundi, soulignant l’absence d’ «avancées significatives» dans les négociations jusqu’à présent.

Des mercenaires russes du groupe Wagner déployés dans l’est de l’Ukraine. «Ils devraient déployer plus de 1 000 mercenaires, dont des responsables de l’organisation, pour mener des opérations de combat», a indiqué lundi soir le ministère britannique de la Défense. «En raison de lourdes pertes et d’une invasion (en Ukraine) largement bloquée, la Russie a très probablement été forcée de redéployer son personnel Wagner pour l’Ukraine aux dépens des opérations en Afrique et en Syrie», estime Londres. Réputée proche de Vladimir Poutine, la sulfureuse société paramilitaire est soupçonnée d’exactions au Mali, en Libye ou encore en Syrie.",https://www.liberation.fr/international/europe/en-direct-guerre-en-ukraine-retrouvez-les-dernieres-informations-liees-a-linvasion-russe-20220329_Z4UXCGMU3VAJ5PIQ2HRBYQXIQQ/
