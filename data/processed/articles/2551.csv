By then, the seventh day of the war in Ukraine, the United Nations estimated that a million people had fled the country. Half a million of them had entered Poland. When new buses arrived from the border, a few miles away, Stupak stood nearby, holding a cardboard sign on which he had scrawled his destinations in northern Poland: Gdańsk, Słupsk, and Bytów. When Stupak’s bus was full, he would leave.

It was a snowy morning. Stupak’s fingers were red with cold. Behind him, a local motorcycle club, in matching leather jackets, had brought a giant, Soviet-era mobile cooker. They were serving bowls of zurek—a traditional Polish soup of sausages, eggs, and potatoes. A few Ukrainians silently ate at a bench next to the soup station. Others took free clothes or free SIM cards from volunteers at other stalls. Those whose phones worked in Poland checked them often, for news from home and for ideas about where to go next.

Stupak told me that he was Ukrainian, but lived in northern Poland with his wife and one-year-old child. He had considered going back to fight, in Ukraine, like many other expatriate men. “I have a lot of anger,” Stupak said. But he was also responsible for his family. His wife spoke no Polish, he said, and it felt impossible to leave her. And so Stupak had volunteered to contribute in another way, by working with a local charity that would not only relocate refugees from the conflict but try to stabilize them in Poland. On the side of his bus was a sign, in Ukrainian, offering rides, accommodation, legal help, and first aid.

Stupak is part of an army of helpers that the Ukrainian diaspora has rallied. Olha Lukianova, who is twenty-nine and lives near Bremen, Germany, is a product manager for an I.T. company. On Wednesday, when I spoke to her by video call, she was driving to Denmark to buy body armor for Ukrainian troops. In the past week, she had driven supplies to the Polish border and organized travel for several displaced families. Now she and her German husband were negotiating with hunting-supply companies in Germany for whatever equipment they could legally buy. “These [items] seem fine for hunting Russians as well,” Lukianova noted.

She told me that most citizens are not allowed to cross into Ukraine with military equipment, but that she and her husband knew a Ukrainian servicewoman who could drive the matériel over the border. Colleagues and strangers were sending Lukianova so much money that she worried her bank account would be frozen because of a suspicious-behavior report.

Across Europe, the story repeated itself, with local variations. Alexey Shumilin, a nurse living in Helsinki, was about to travel for two days, by ferry and car, to the Polish border to pick up refugees and bring them back to Finland. His mother and grandmother were in Sumy, a Ukrainian city by the Russian border, but were unable to leave. Because he could not help his family, he decided to help strangers. “It’s just impossible to see [the news] without taking action,” he said.

Julia Valova, a thirty-five-year-old who works in Budapest, was manning the phones and coördinating volunteers through a Ukrainian Catholic foundation. “Mr. Putin didn’t split the country like he wanted. He just made us more united,” she said. “He made us crazy.”

Volodymyr Voyevodin, a twenty-six-year-old architect living in Prague, was gathering medicines and driving supplies to the border. He told me that he felt a certain amount of shame at not having returned to fight. (“I had a moment with my friends: ‘Tomorrow, we’re going to leave!’ ”) In the end, he decided that he would be a better helper than a soldier. He has since thrown himself into his work. When we spoke, it had been a long time since he’d slept. There were twenty thousand Ukrainians in the Czech Republic when he last looked at the numbers. All of them needed something.

Volunteers across Europe have gathered supplies for Ukrainian refugees.

When the war started, Pavlo Pedenko, a thirty-three-year-old senior product manager at a fintech company, had moved from London to Budapest, to be nearer to Ukraine. He had since helped to ship hundreds of computers to the Ukrainian Army, and also to connect refugees travelling to similar destinations through BlaBlaCar, a ride-sharing app that is popular in Central Europe. “I considered going back to Ukraine, but there’s no way I could do this volunteering work,” he said. “There’s no normal Internet connection there. And being less distracted by a bomb going off over your head is helpful when you’re actually trying to accomplish something.”

By mid-afternoon on Wednesday, the flow of buses from the border to the Przemysl transit center was thickening, and there were hundreds of refugees attempting to find a ride to their next destination. Volunteers stood at the doors of the newly arrived buses and shouted the desired destinations to a gaggle of willing drivers gathered around. “Warsaw!” one would shout, and somebody in the crowd would wave. A family was connected to a driver.

Alongside many Ukrainians and Poles offering rides and accommodation were those who had no direct connection to the crisis. One Belgian man, Bernard Bousson, wore an expensive-looking overcoat. He had not told his wife and kids that he was coming. He was fifty-three, and remembered feeling helpless at the time of the Balkan wars, in the nineteen-nineties. Now he had money, time, and a car. He had driven for two days to get to the Polish border, and would drive a family anywhere they wanted to go in Belgium or Germany. Michael Wilspang, a fifty-four-year-old Danish electrical engineer who lives on the remote island of Ærø, had seen a report on the news that he had found affecting. Wilspang could not bear the thought of children suffering needlessly, and he was now offering a ride and accommodation.

But, for all of this outpouring of help, many refugees were rattled by uncertainty. Anastasiia Svietlova, who is thirty-three, told me that she lived in the first building in Kyiv that was hit by a bomb. She was unharmed in the explosion, but it was obvious that she needed to flee, along with her five-year-old daughter, Ksenia. It took them six days from the time they left Kyiv to cross the border. By Wednesday, Ksenia had found some other children to play with, and toys were strewn around her. But Svietlova could not stop crying. She had a sister in Wroclaw, in Poland, and would try to reach her. But the sister’s apartment had only one bedroom; the situation was temporary. Svietlova wondered where she would go next, or whether she could return to Ukraine to see her husband. I asked her what she had told Ksenia about what had happened to their country, and to their family.

“I told her the truth,” Svietlova said. “There is war.”

Volunteers distribute food, SIM cards, and other aid to refugees at a transit center on the outskirts of Przemysl, Poland.

Kostiantyn Stupak now had about thirty people for his bus to northern Poland. Sitting inside was Lidia Matvienko, a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother who was travelling with her daughter and her dog. Matvienko’s granddaughter was studying at a university near Gdańsk, and had begged the two women to come. Now, Matvienko told me, she had only the clothes that she was wearing, and a small bag on the seat beside her. She had wanted to stay in Ukraine. “I just don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said.

The temperature outside had dropped well below freezing, but the bus was warm, for which Matvienko was grateful. Somebody was changing a baby’s diaper, while another passenger tried to keep a lapdog under control. Stupak was still outside the bus, waiting for more people to board. He hoped to leave in the next hour or two, because he had to work the next day. “Although they can fire me if they want,” he said. “I’m not leaving here until the bus is full.”",https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/an-outpouring-of-support-for-ukraine

Murphy', 'Tim Lister']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) Russia's relentless bombardment of residential areas across Ukraine has so far forced more than one million refugees to flee the country in just seven days, according to the United Nations, as fierce fighting continues into its second week.

Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Thursday: ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.""

By comparison, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures there were at their height, according to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.

Half a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crises since World War II.

Millions more people are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine, Grandi said. He added: ""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy.""

In Ukraine's capital Kyiv, residents were awoken in the early hours of Thursday by at least one large explosion in the southwest of the city, following a day of heavy shelling. To the south, the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And in the port city of Mariupol , home to roughly 400,000, residents are without electricity and water, according to local officials, as Russian troops step up their offensive.

A woman sits in a tent as people take shelter in the Dorohozhychi subway station in Kyiv on Wednesday.

A resident of Kherson, which has about 300,000 inhabitants, described the situation there as a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" telling CNN Thursday there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities.

According to the local resident, there is a severe lack of food and medicine -- particularly insulin -- with pharmacies being looted.

The resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.

The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said Wednesday the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.

In Mariupol, the deputy mayor said on Thursday morning that the southeastern Ukrainian city had faced 26 hours of continued shelling and warned it now faces a humanitarian crisis.

""They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,"" Sergei Orlov told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating.""

Further north, Ukrainian resistance in the country's second biggest city, Kharkiv, continues to hold out, as Russian strikes hit at least three schools and damaged a cathedral and shops on Wednesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media, geolocated and verified by CNN.

In a broadcast message Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Russian forces, saying: ""You are leaving people without food, you are leaving us without medication. You are shelling evacuation routes, there's no weapon you wouldn't use against us, against free citizens of Ukraine.""

Most of those who have fled the country have gone to Poland, to Ukraine's west, with large numbers also entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city.

Worryingly, a ""big number"" of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland's Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents -- particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said.

Humanitarian corridors

On Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that.

Senior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: ""The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.""

The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media.

""We have thoroughly discussed three points -- military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,"" Medinsky told journalists.

Another member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the ""nearest future.""

Meanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.

The European Union has made the ""historic decision"" to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc's Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday.

The United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia's ongoing invasion.

Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally.

Bachelet said: ""Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped.""

With the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.""

The move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially ""tens of thousands"" of troops.

The Russian government has ""strongly"" rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine.

It's unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas.

On Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was ""gravely concerned"" by ""reports of the use of cluster munitions"" by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine.

""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs -- which are banned under the Geneva Convention,"" she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.

There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26.

The Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.

""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,"" NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN

He said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins.

""I'm afraid to say I don't think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that's likely to happen,"" Shirreff added.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl-hnk/index.html

Children's faces peeking from the windows of buses and trains heading to European cities.

These are just some of the images of the more than one million people the UN says have now fled their homes, workplaces, and schools in Ukraine since Russian troops began invading the Eastern European country a week ago.

The numbers are staggering right now—they seem to go up every hour

""The numbers are staggering right now. They seem to go up every hour,"" says Rachel Levitan, vice president of international policy and relations for HIAS, a global nonprofit organization that focuses on protecting and resettling refugees in partnership with the Ukrainian organization Right to Protection.

Their health, safety, and relocation needs are staggering, too. There are multiple nongovernmental organizations stepping in to provide care and resources, explains Adrianna Murphy, associate professor of Health Services Research and Policy, and co-director of the Centre for Global Chronic Conditions, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).

""The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will coordinate the refugee response with other UN agencies. They will work with implementing partners who will actually deliver care, including organizations like the International Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the International Rescue Committee,"" she says.

Right now, humanitarian groups are focusing on providing people arriving at the borders of neighboring countries with a mix of first aid, shelter, food, and water—basic needs—and even SIM cards, so people can stay in touch with family, said Birgitte Bischoff Ebbesen, the regional director for Europe at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, who spoke at a press conference this week.

At the borders, she said, ""Our special focus will be on unaccompanied minors, single women with children, and seniors."" She noted though that they also have volunteers currently in bomb shelters assisting people still in Ukraine.

But despite immediate needs being met, the situation is ""incredibly tense, dangerous, and distressing,"" said Martin Schüepp, regional director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Committee of the Red Cross, who also spoke at this week's press conference. Some of the most vulnerable are the hardest hit.

""Our Red Cross team is reporting people in despair… there is significant emotional distress and trauma,"" Schüepp said.

In the days ahead, the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations hope to open up humanitarian corridors—which Ukraine and Russia have agreed to—where people fleeing and the injured can move or be moved safely.

""What these refugees are facing, it's really just the beginning of the journey,"" says Talia Inlender, deputy director of The Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.

Flooding to Ukraine's Borders

Bordering Ukraine to the west and south are Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova—all of which are taking in refugees. Poland has by far the most people pouring across national lines, says Kristof Veres, a senior researcher at the Hungarian Migration Research Institute (Migrációkutató Intézet), who is also currently an Andrassy national security fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, in Washington, DC. The UNHCR reported close to 650,000 arrivals at the Polish border as of March 3, with Hungary receiving the second largest number of people, at 144,738.

Refugee Arrivals from Ukraine to Bordering Countries

Among the crowds seeking refuge in nearby nations are many who are not from Ukraine— including students, workers, athletes, and visitors from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East—but who were in the country when war broke out. There are 18,000 students from India alone in Ukraine. So far, 4,000 have crossed into nearby countries, escaping the Russian invasion. A fourth-year medical student from India tragically lost his life in Kharkiv when he left a shelter to buy food for others.

Thousands of students from Africa study in Ukraine, as well. The African Union published a statement this past week on the reported ill treatment of Africans trying to leave the embattled nation, calling for everyone to have ""the same rights to cross to safety from the conflict in Ukraine, notwithstanding their nationality or racial identity.""

Red Cross staff and other humanitarian organizations now working in Ukraine border countries were prepared for this emergency. Mesfin Teklu Tessema, senior director of health at the International Rescue Committee (IRC), says Poland had been readying for a possible influx over recent weeks.

""We have been monitoring the escalation of this conflict since early February, so we had a team deployed in Poland early in the first week of February to monitor as well as prepare,"" he says.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins San Frontières has also been setting up emergency response activities in border nations, dispatching teams to Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

American officials estimate that ultimately, up to five million people from Ukraine may seek protection in neighboring countries in the coming weeks and months, and they say U.S. troops are now in Poland helping Polish forces establish processing centers for those arriving.

Reaching the Border, Then What?

At the borders, there are miles-long queues—mostly women and children. It can take up to two days to get through. Many need health care by the time they reach the front of the line, after long treks in cold weather. The elderly and other vulnerable people are especially at risk for health complications.

""The immediate health needs of refugees generally, and of Ukrainians, are those things that require regular access to health care—antenatal care, treatment of chronic communicable diseases like TB and HIV, and that of chronic non-communicable conditions like hypertension or diabetes,"" says Murphy.

Safety is also a major focus for humanitarian groups. ""We are trying to make sure there is adequate space, that there is no risk of gender-based attack—especially for women and girls,"" says IRC's Teklu Tessema.

For the most part, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia have completely opened their borders to refugees from Ukraine, says Veres. After identification checks are made, people are registered, given phone numbers for agencies that can help, medical care, food, hot tea, and blankets, and then they await transportation to major European cities, Veres says.

In Hungary, people can travel for free on a train reserved for refugees to Budapest and when they arrive there, government agencies and NGOs will help, first determining if they have relatives or know someone in Hungary, and if not, connecting them with relatives and friends in any other EU country and arranging transportation. If they don't have contacts, then agencies arrange accommodations for them.

""It was a totally different process before the war,"" says Veres.

COVID-19 transmission is of deep concern to global health experts. LSHTM's Murphy said this refugee crisis is unique because it is happening while Eastern Europe is still in the midst of the pandemic.

""Before Russia invaded, Ukraine was seeing 25,000 new cases each day. Only 40 percent of Ukrainians are vaccinated and many refugees are traveling in crowded buses, trains, or other vehicles. It's possible that the COVID-related care will become important,"" Murphy adds.

COVID-related medical supplies and oxygen are critical, says IRC's Teklu Tessema. ""The country was running out of supplies, and the World Health Organization (WHO) and others have actually donated quite a lot. I think we saw that oxygen supply arrived in Poland to be shipped to Ukraine. So that's the kind of thing that is needed so that people who need medical treatment can get it so they don't have to die of preventable causes,"" he says.

Longer-Term Health After Displacement

In forced displacement crises, people are often traumatized, says Levitan. ""From listening to Ukrainians in the last couple of weeks, it was clear that people were not expecting this. They did not have their bags packed. Many now feel like they’re reliving the traumas that their parents and grandparents experienced during the Second World War,"" she says.

Among those displaced due to the ongoing conflict between Ukrainians and Russian-backed separatists in the eastern region of Donbas, as of 2019, between 17 to 32 percent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety, Murphy said. And almost three-quarters of those were untreated.

Mental health and psychosocial support will be critical not just for people who've left Ukraine, but for people who are still there, including humanitarian staff who will have witnessed Russia's full-scale attack on Ukraine, which has targeted civilians, neighborhoods, hospitals, and university buildings, among other locations.

Teklu Tessema is extremely concerned about supply chain disruptions and the massive upheaval of health services there, including the medical care that will be needed for the wounded.

""These are some of the health challenges that we are looking at and we think health services should be protected in these times of crisis to make sure that people continue to receive care,"" he says, noting that attacks on hospitals are a violation of international humanitarian law.

Medications to treat the most prevalent conditions and diseases in Ukraine—hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease—will be needed. ""Untreated, they can cause severe health consequences, or death,"" Murphy says.

""The longer this drags on, the more widespread and intense the need is going to get,"" says Judy Twigg, professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University. If this crisis stretches out, she adds, listening to health personnel on the ground in Ukraine and at the borders is going to be critical.

""Listen to what they need and where they need it. And work with established organizations,"" says Twigg, who notes that sending cash to verified humanitarian organizations can buy what they need, when they need it, and it is more useful than collecting and donating blankets.

WHO has a long established, important presence in Ukraine and will be doing a lot of coordinating, serving as an information clearing house for things that are needed. Whether or not WHO should cut ties with Russia is being debated by many leaders and health experts.

Twigg says, ""WHO should reassess its relationship with Russia immediately, especially some of its higher-profile partnerships like the WHO European office on non-communicable diseases in Moscow.""

“Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence. Countless have been displaced inside the country,” Filippo Grandi said in a statement. “And unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine.”

Intensification of the Russian offensive has seen multiple cities across the country come under air and ground attack in the past week. Russian tanks and armored vehicles are continuing to roll through the country threatening several large cities.

Grandi told the U.N. Security Council on Monday that he had not seen “such an incredibly fast-rising exodus of people – the largest, surely, within Europe, since the Balkan wars.”

He said unless there is an immediate halt to the conflict, people will continue to flee.

“We are currently planning – repeat: planning – for up to four million refugees in the coming days and weeks,” Grandi said Monday.

When he briefed the council on Monday, he said more than 280,000 people had fled to Poland alone. As of Wednesday, UNHCR said the number had nearly doubled to 547,982 people.

Numbers of refugees are also rising quickly in Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania and other European countries. Nearly 50,000 people, primarily from eastern Ukraine, have also sought refuge in Russia.

The U.N. Children’s agency, UNICEF, says half of those fleeing the country are children.

The U.N. appealed Tuesday for $1.7 billion to meet emergency needs inside and in neighboring countries for the next three months. Nations stepped up immediately with $1.5 billion in pledges. UNHCR hopes to assist 2.4 million refugees and asylum-seekers with money from the appeal.

The United States announced $54 million in new humanitarian funding last week for Ukrainians.

“They are fleeing increasingly violent and widespread strikes by Russian forces against residential areas and infrastructure – from the shelling of hospitals and kindergartens to rockets targeting central city squares,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement. “The human toll of Russia's unprovoked and unjustifiable attack against its sovereign neighbor is growing exponentially each day.”",https://www.voanews.com/a/un-refugee-chief-1-million-have-fled-ukraine-in-russian-invasion-s-first-week/6468474.html

""Kids screaming, mothers screaming, it's so crazy this panic,"" Konstantyn Makarin, a 45-year-old circus acrobat, told NBC News correspondent Richard Engel. ""People are so afraid.""

Earlier this week, the Ukraine State Border Guard Service announced that men ages 18 to 60 were prohibited from leaving the country after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law.

So it was just women, children and the elderly pushing their way onto the trains for Lviv. And every time a track was announced, the crowd made a mad dash for the train, sometimes clambering over the tracks.

""They're trying to cram as many people as possible on this train,"" Engel reported. ""It feels like we've stepped back into World War II.""

Lviv, Ukraine

When the air raid sirens went off in Lviv on Friday, there were thousands of people huddled inside the main train station and there was no place for them to hide.

So the crowd, mostly women carrying babies or holding their children's hands, with all the possessions they could grab in wheeled bags, ignored the sirens and continued chattering. But there was ""desperation in their eyes,"" NBC News producer Paul Goldman reported from the scene.

Meanwhile, Nate Mook of the World Central Kitchen had set up shop near the train station and was trying to feed and comfort as many people as he could.

""It’s really heartbreaking to watch what’s happening as families are having to flee their homes, abandon their lives,"" he said.

The refugees arriving in Lviv on Friday were mostly from Kharkiv, where some of the fiercest fighting has taken place.

""As you can see, a lot of small children are here, a lot of infants, a lot of babies,"" he said. ""It’s freezing cold outside. So it just gives them a spot to kind of regroup and they get a hot meal, they can catch their breath, figure out what’s next.""

Korczewo, Poland

One of the Ukrainian refugees who arrived in this border town Friday was a 64-year-old named Anatoly who was carrying a bag of clothes and a guilty conscience.

Weeping, Anatoly told NBC News producer Konstantin Shukhnov that his village of Borodyanka, northwest of Kyiv, had been attacked several days ago by Russian tanks while he was visiting a friend.

He said his wife had taken shelter in the root cellar of their home, but it was inadvertently bombed by Ukrainian fighter planes that chased off the Russians.

Anatoly said when he got to the house, he realized his wife was buried somewhere beneath the ruins. But when he saw the Russians coming back, he took off running.

“I left my wife and I have no idea if she is dead or alive,” Anatoly said.

Krakow, Poland

Ukrainians who were able to get out say the idea of not knowing what to do next has been torture.

Olga Tsoi, a Ukrainian American from Chicago, was visiting her family in the city of Kherson and said it took her 72 hours to reach the Polish border.

Now ensconced in a Krakow hotel, she had nothing but praise for her Polish hosts but said she feared for her family in Kherson, which is now in Russian hands.

""Everybody is really worried what's going to happen next because they are running out of food, and right now it's not safe to get outside and go to a store,"" she told MSNBC's Chris Jansing.

Tsoi said she is trying get her mother out of Kherson but there ""doesn't seem like there's a clear passage to get my mom to the United States since she doesn't have a residency or visa.""

William Shaw, an American expat living in the ancient Polish city, told MSNBC he has taken in several Ukrainian refugees, and that across Poland, ""there's a rush of goodwill.""

Poland has taken in nearly 650,000 Ukrainian refugees, according to the most recent U.N. figures, half of the 1.2 million people who have fled the country.

And the country was already sheltering close to 2 million Ukrainians who arrived in 2014 after Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces seized the Crimean Peninsula.

Asked if Poland can take many more Ukrainians, Shaw said, ""absolutely not.""

""And that's probably what Putin wanted, but we're going to do our best,"" he said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/heartbreaking-watch-scenes-ukrainian-exodus-rcna18758

Fearful of the threat from the Russian invasion, they had decided it was time to leave, and make their way along with tens of thousands of others to the safer regions of western Ukraine.

It was slow going. The roads were jammed with Ukrainians making a similar exodus. As they settled in for a few hours of sleep on a set of cots sized for 4-year-olds, air raid sirens blared from the administrative building next door.

The next morning, as snow fell outside, 11-year-old Karolyna Tupytska and her younger sister Albina brushed their teeth, played with a small Terrier and braced themselves for another long day of travel. They were headed to Poland with their mother, Lyuba.

“My grandparents and my dad are still in Cherkasy,” Karolyna said. She said she was sad to leave behind her white hamster, Pearl.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/world/europe/ukraine-refugees-exodus.html
