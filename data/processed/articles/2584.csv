OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Foreign Minister of Poland Zbigniew Rau and OSCE Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid extend their most heartfelt condolences to Maryna’s loved ones, as well as to the SMM as a whole:

“Our deepest condolences and sympathies go to Maryna’s family. Maryna was a valued member of the SMM team, and our colleagues in Ukraine remain in close contact with her family to offer our support.”

“Maryna was killed while getting supplies for her family in a city that has become a war zone. In Kharkiv and other cities and towns in Ukraine, missiles, shells and rockets are hitting residential buildings and town centers, killing and injuring innocent civilians – women, men and children alike.""

""Despite repeated calls from across the international community, and from across the OSCE, the unprovoked military operation against Ukraine continues. We strongly condemn the increased shelling in urban areas centres causing death and injury to civilians and reiterate our call on the Russian Federation for an immediate cessation of hostilities and to engage in a meaningful dialogue.""","https://www.osce.org/chairmanship/513280#:~:text=VIENNA%2FWARSAW%20%E2%80%93%20Maryna%20Fenina%2C,in%20Kharkiv%20yesterday%2C%201%20March."
