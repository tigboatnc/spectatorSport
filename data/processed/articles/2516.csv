MOSCOW, March 3 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told French leader Emmanuel Macron on Thursday that Russia would achieve the goals of its military intervention in Ukraine whatever happens, the Kremlin said.

In a statement issued after the French and Russian presidents spoke by phone, the Kremlin made clear its goals included the demilitarisation and neutrality of Ukraine.

Any attempts by Kyiv to delay negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials would result in Moscow adding more items to a list of demands it has already set out, it said.

""Vladimir Putin outlined in detail the fundamental approaches and conditions in the context of negotiations with representatives of Kyiv. It was confirmed that, first of all, we are talking about the demilitarisation and neutral status of Ukraine, so that a threat to the Russian Federation will never emanate from its territory,"" the statement said.

""It was emphasised that the tasks of the special military operation will be fulfilled in any event, and attempts to gain time by dragging out negotiations will only lead to additional demands on Kiev in our negotiating position.""

The statement said Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine was going ""according to plan"". It said reports that Russian forces were bombarding Kyiv were part of an ""anti-Russia disinformation campaign"", and that Russian forces were doing all they could to protect civilians.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Any attempts by Kyiv to delay negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials would result in Moscow adding more items to a list of demands it has already set out, it said.

“Vladimir Putin outlined in detail the fundamental approaches and conditions in the context of negotiations with representatives of Kyiv. It was confirmed that, first of all, we are talking about the demilitarisation and neutral status of Ukraine, so that a threat to the Russian Federation will never emanate from its territory,” the statement said.

“It was emphasised that the tasks of the special military operation will be fulfilled in any event, and attempts to gain time by dragging out negotiations will only lead to additional demands on Kiev in our negotiating position.”

The statement said Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine was going “according to plan”. It said reports that Russian forces were bombarding Kyiv were part of an “anti-Russia disinformation campaign”, and that Russian forces were doing all they could to protect civilians.

A French official also offered a readout.

“Our analysis of the military operations is that the Russian ambitions are to take control of all of Ukraine,” said a senior official in the French presidency, who briefed reporters on the 90-minute conversation between the two leaders and said Macron expressed “pessimism” after the call.

Nothing is certain about the success of Russia’s operations, but “we have to expect that the worst is to come,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with French government practice. “There is nothing in what President Putin said that should reassure us,” the official added.

The call, which the French presidency said came at the Kremlin’s request, was the third discussion between the two leaders since the start of the war.

Even as the French presidency stressed that France would keep diplomatic lines open with Russia as long as necessary — including to organize the passage of humanitarian aid — the successive phone calls have shown the limits of Macron’s outreach to Putin.

The French official offered a grim assessment of Putin’s determination to pursue the conflict, saying that the Russian leader repeated a lengthy list of grievances and perceived slights from Western countries that he said had forced him to act. Putin also repeated demands that the Ukrainian government and other European countries have already deemed unacceptable, the official said.

Macron reportedly told Putin that he was making a “serious mistake” and was “deluding himself” and “looking for pretexts” with his assertions that the Kyiv government was run by Nazis, the official said. He said that Macron warned that Russia would pay dearly, leaving the country “weakened, isolated and under sanctions for a very long time.”

As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed 1 million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the French official said.

Putin said Moscow aimed to take “full control” of the country by diplomatic or military means and repeated his objective was what he claimed was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-nazification” of Ukraine, the official said.

Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term. “There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the official said, adding that Macron had told him he was “lying to himself”.

As talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators got under way, the Russian leader said separately that the invasion – which Russia still calls a “special military operation” – was going according to plan and praised Russia’s soldiers as heroes. “All the tasks that have been set are being successfully resolved,” he said.

Putin claimed in a television address that Moscow’s advance was progressing even as his troops appear to have made slower progress than many experts predicted. “I want to say that the special military operation is going strictly according to schedule,” he said, opening a meeting with his security council.

In Moscow, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed rumours that the government, faced with international condemnation and deepening economic isolation, was about to introduce martial law, which would include border controls and military censorship. The reports, which have sparked a small-scale exodus, were “hoaxes”, Peskov said.

Putin’s forces, meanwhile, were battling to control several southern cities including Enerhodar, the site of Europe’s largest nuclear plant, as part of what appears to be a plan to cut Ukraine off from the sea, stifling its economy but also creating a land corridor stretching from Russia westwards to Romania.

The regional governor in Kherson, on the Black Sea, said on Thursday that Russian soldiers had occupied the regional administration building, after the city’s mayor said Russian soldiers were in de facto control of the local council building.

“I didn’t make any promises to them … I just asked them not to shoot people,” said Ihor Kolykhaiev. The apparent capture of Kherson, strategically located at the mouth of the Dnieper River, marks the first significant urban centre to fall since Moscow launched its invasion on 24 February.

Mariupol, another large port city on the Azov Sea, was also reportedly encircled and without light, water or heat. The city council said the shelling had been relentless and Russian troops were creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” by trying to prevent civilians leaving.

“They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade,” the council said. “Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying critical life-support infrastructure. This is genocide of Ukrainian people.”

Residents of Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest port city and a vital link in Ukraine’s economy, were also preparing to defend it amid warnings of an imminent Russian seaborne landing. Airstrikes on the city have multiplied and a Russian naval convoy of at least eight ships was seen off the coast.

Ukrainian negotiators who met a Russian delegation for talks on Thursday with the objective of securing an immediate ceasefire said the two sides had agreed to hold a third round of talks soon and “reached an understanding” on the joint provision of humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.

“Not everywhere, but in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,” said the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned that if the west did not increase military aid, Russia would advance on the rest of Europe. “If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!” he said. “If we are no more, then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next.”

Zelenskiy called for direct talks with Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Ukraine was “not attacking Russia … What do you want from us? Leave our land.” The Ukrainian president said in an earlier video his country’s defensive lines were holding and praised the nation’s resistance.

Heavy shelling was again reported in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people where emergency services said 34 civilians had been killed in the past 24 hours. A university and a hospital were hit, and TV footage showed a city-centre wasteland of ruined buildings and debris.

Russia’s advance on the capital, however, had made little progress, the UK’s defence ministry said. “The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km (19 miles) from the centre, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,” it said.

Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the situation in the capital was “difficult but under control”, adding that there had been no casualties overnight and that explosions heard overnight were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles.

The UN human rights office has confirmed the deaths of 227 civilians and 525 injuries during the fighting, but said the actual toll would already be much higher. Ukraine has said at least 350 civilians have died and more than 2,000 have been injured.

The UN refugee agency said the number of people fleeing the country had surpassed 1 million by early Thursday morning – about 2% of Ukraine’s population of 44 million – adding that “at this rate” the exodus could make the country the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century”.

The Russian attack has led to a barrage of international sanctions that have plunged Russia’s economy into chaos and ever deepening isolation. The rouble again hit record lows on Thursday after the credit ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to “junk” status, while an estimated 80% of Russian banks’ assets – and half its central bank’s reserves – had been immobilised.

French authorities on Thursday seized the Amore Vero, a superyacht owned by a company linked to Igor Sechin, chief executive of the Russian energy giant Rosneft, at La Ciotat, near Marseille, after reports that German authorities had seized the superyacht Dilbar belonging to the billionaire Alisher Usmanov on Wednesday.

The White House imposed additional sanctions on more Russian oligarchs including the billionaire businessmen Boris and Arkady Rotenberg and Usmanov, one of Putin’s closest allies, as well as Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson. The US also imposed visa bans on 19 oligarchs and their family members.” These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the US financial system; their assets in the US will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use,” the White House said.

Russian President Putin spoke to French President Macron on Thursday amid Russia’s continued attacks on Ukraine. According to the report, during this time Putin told Macron that the purpose of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine is to demilitarize it and maintain its neutral position, so that there is no threat to Russia from Ukrainian territory. In addition, Putin warned in talks with Macron that the Russian side would continue the fight against militants of nationalist armed groups in Ukraine without a deal.

Russia will continue to fight

According to the Kremlin, it is noted that during the Special Operations for the Defense of the Donbass, Russia intends to continue the uncompromising fight against militants of nationalist armed groups who commit war crimes, including placing military equipment in residential areas and using the civilian population as a human shield.

Putin also discussed humanitarian issues

Putin said negotiations must center on the “neutralization and disarmament of Ukraine,” according to the French official. Putin reportedly said he would attain that goal by military means, if not by political and diplomatic means.

The statements apparently didn't provide Macon with confidence that the conflict would end anytime soon. He reportedly fears the worst is yet to come, according to French news agency AFP.
