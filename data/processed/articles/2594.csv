Thousands of M72 anti-tank launchers ready for action in Ukraine – The M72 light anti-tank weapon (LAW) is seeing the battlefield in high numbers in Ukraine after a donation by the Canadian military.

The LAW is nothing new, but it is combat-proven. Canada announced it was sending 4,500 M72 rocket launchers to Ukraine earlier this month. These weapons should be in the hands of Ukrainian fighters by now. Norway (2,000 units) and Denmark (2,700) have also provided the M72 LAW to Ukraine.

The M72 LAW has its advantages

The LAW is similar to the AT4 tank killer. It is a single-use disposable tube-shaped weapon fired from the shoulder. With a range of up to 656 feet, the LAW can punch through 12 inches of armor with a formidable shaped charge.

The LAW is a version of the portable, lightweight 66mm rocket launcher from 1956. The improved LAW has a velocity of 650 feet per second.

M72 LAW: history of the weapon

The LAW has been around since the early 1960s for use against Soviet light tanks in Europe. The one-shot, one-kill disposable rocket system was considered innovative.

Soldiers and Marines in Vietnam used it to penetrate and destroy enemy bunkers. But this early version was not effective against North Vietnamese Army tanks. Some rockers fizzled out or did not detonate on impact in certain battles.

Since then, the LAW has been improved with about a dozen variants beyond the original launcher. It has seen combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and has garnered better reviews.

M72 still highly regarded in the modern era

Users in Ukraine can deploy the weapon against not only tanks (with the high-explosive anti-tank round) but buildings and lighter-armored vehicles such as Russian armored personnel carriers. American soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division gave the trusty old weapon a solid evaluation in an after-action report from 2010.

""The M72s provided the best balance of weight and bulk to combat effectiveness. It was considered an excellent munition to be used against insurgents firing from close and medium range. It was fast and easy to bring into operation, and it was considered to be both a good suppressive weapon and quite accurate and lethal at the same time,"" according to the lessons-learned paper.

DVIDS

M72 is easy to use

Firing is straightforward making it perfect for training inexperienced fighters in Ukraine such as members of the reserve territorial defense forces.

Just pull out the arming pin, take off the rear cover and sling, grasp the rear cover to extend the tube fully, pull the trigger handle to the armed position, aim and fire. The gas pressure for the 66mm rocket does the rest.

The M72 Is light and lethal

The great thing about the M72 LAW is its portability. It only weighs 5.5 pounds. Soldiers can carry it with a sling while also keeping their rifle at the ready. However, there is a danger from the backblast, and operators are trained to look behind the weapon tube to make sure friendlies are not in the caution or danger zone.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for anti-tank munitions, although he would prefer modern guided weapons such as the Javelin fire-and-forget system. But the LAW is cheaper, easier to carry, and simple to train on.

As long as soldiers are in range and have adequate line-of-sight, the LAW can be lethal against enemy tanks and armored vehicles. The Kremlin has clearly underestimated what a motivated Ukrainian fighter can do with an anti-tank weapon. The LAW will continue to make the Russians pay for this oversight.

3,943849ab-4e09-468e-9795-71b7d96caf0e,[],2022-04-02 00:00:00,"The word ""miscalculation"" has been thrown around a lot to describe Vladimir Putin's attempt to annex Ukraine, but perhaps his biggest miscalculation lay in thinking he could do it using tanks as his primary weapon. It's clear as the sixth week of the war begins that his apparent plan was to send a column of tanks rumbling into Kyiv, blow up a few things, send Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government scampering away in fear, declare victory, install a puppet president and go home. Evidence that his plan was a strategic, tactical and political failure is showing on your television screens around the clock. If there is one image that will symbolize forever this war, it will be a blown-up Russian tank, its treads sagging and its turret tilted, rusting by the side of the road in Ukraine.

Thirty years ago, this country used two armored cavalry regiments, a mechanized infantry division and a 400 helicopter-strong air assault to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi forces. Huge formations of tanks crossed the border from Saudi Arabia following massive airstrikes on Iraqi positions. During the assault, three epic tank battles were fought in the desert of Kuwait, one of which is thought to have been the largest tank battle in American history. In less than 100 hours of fighting, U.S. forces destroyed 1,350 Iraqi tanks and 1,224 armored personnel carriers (APCs). In all, some 5,000 Iraqi armored combat vehicles were destroyed, damaged or captured. The U.S. military lost a single Bradley fighting vehicle. What is now known as the first Gulf War was the most celebrated and successful use of armored weaponry in modern history. It seemed as Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles rolled to victory in Kuwait City that powerful armored vehicles had proved their worth as weapons of modern war.

RELATED: Putin's massive miscalculation: Echoes of George W. Bush — and a lesson for America's elites

Putin's attempt to take that lesson and apply it to Ukraine has failed abjectly, and it's not just because the deserts of a Kuwait winter are more amenable to tank battles than the muddy flatlands of an Eastern European spring. Yes, 30 years have passed, and Russia has not kept up with modern technology and tactics, but it's more than that. The fierce determination of Ukraine's fighters has played an outsized role throwing Russian forces into disarray, but size and money and ease of use have played large roles, too.

Russian tanks have met their match because of two Western-made rockets, the U.S. Javelin and the British Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW). Both are lightweight, easily portable, deadly accurate, relatively inexpensive and designed to get around every attempt of modern armor design to defeat them. Lightly armored Russian personnel carriers, constructed mostly of aluminum, can be destroyed using Russia's own RPG-7 rocket launcher, which was designed and deployed more than 60 years ago.

Ukrainian forces have expertly used the Javelin and the NLAW to destroy Russian tanks as they have moved in convoys and deployed in combat to assault Ukrainian cities and towns. The weapons are carried by infantry soldiers on foot and can be fired from positions of cover and concealment. Both are ""fire and forget"" weapons, meaning that once they have been aimed at a target and tracked for a short period, they can be fired by the user, who is then able to drop the weapon and move away to safety. The NLAW is disposable. The weapon is meant to fire a single missile and then be discarded. The American Javelin can be reloaded and used to fire multiple missiles, but in an emergency can be discarded if the soldier using it has come under fire and must retreat from his or her position. Both weapons are designed to use high-tech location systems to hit the tops of tank turrets where they are lightly armored and highly vulnerable.

But here is the real deal: The NLAW disposable missile costs around $25,000, and the Javelin rocket launcher system costs about $180,000 and fires a missile that costs around $75,000. Both rocket launchers are being used in Ukraine to destroy tanks that cost upwards of $2 million each. The cost differential is obvious. It's even better when you consider the RPG-7, which costs around $1,000 and fires missiles that can cost as little as $100 each. (Costs can go up to as much as $500 for RPG warheads when they use armor piercing or air-burst technology.) Their cost-effectiveness is amazing when you consider that they're being used to knock out Russian APCs costing more than $1 million each. In Iraq, the same RPGs were used by insurgents to bring down American Apache and Blackhawk helicopters that cost between $6 million and $13 million each, depending on the model and year of manufacture.

Ukraine has also made use of armed drones against Russia's heavy armor, such as the T-72 tank. The drones were acquired from Turkey and fire ""smart"" bombs that are much more expensive than Javelin rounds but have been extremely effective, especially when used to destroy tanks in convoys, where even one disabled tank becomes an obstacle to every vehicle behind it. The infamous 40-mile Russian convoy that moved slowly from the Belarus border to positions around Kyiv was stalled repeatedly by Ukrainian drones and anti-tank weapons fired by infantry. RPGs were also used to take out Russian ammunition and fuel trucks, making the units they were meant to serve less combat-effective.

The only thing the Russian military has been really good at in this war is standing back and shelling civilian areas — in other words, committing war crimes.

In fact, Russia's use of armored weapons like tanks and APCs has been a bust. The only thing the Russian military has been effective at doing is standing back from Ukrainian cities and shelling civilian areas with artillery and rocket launchers, which is to say the one thing they've been really good at is committing war crimes. Russia has also been very reluctant to employ its helicopters for both air-mobile infantry and gunship use because the Ukrainian military has been supplied with Stinger and other anti-aircraft missiles, which have been used to take down Russian helicopters as well as fighter-bomber jet aircraft. The cost differential between the ground-based Stingers and expensive Russian air force jets is enormous, which is why Russia has failed to achieve air superiority despite its far better equipped air force and army helicopter units. They have been reluctant to put them in the air, knowing Ukrainians with Stingers are waiting for them on the ground.

The Pentagon has for several decades had a team of military officers from the three major services, along with civilian defense experts and scientists, whose task is to look 25 years ahead, constantly trying to predict what the warfare of the future will look like and prepare for it. Thirty years ago, when the U.S. drove Saddam's army out of Kuwait, we didn't face anti-tank weapons like the Javelin and NLAW. The technology of that time was the plain and simple LAW, a disposable anti-tank weapon that fired an inaccurate unguided warhead that wasn't capable of penetrating American armor, much less the enemy armor of that time.

The Pentagon doesn't talk much about what its seers into warfare's future are up to, but they must be studying what has happened to Russian armor faced with the much smaller and less well-equipped Ukrainian army. Russia has had major problems moving its armored units from their positions across the border before the war into Ukraine, even more problems supplying their tanks and APCs with fuel once they were underway, and problems after that resupplying and refueling tanks once they reached positions where they could be used in combat to invade Ukrainian cities and take territory. Tanks have historically been one of an army's weapons of terror. Their fearsome appearance and firepower has had an understandably intimidating effect on both infantry soldiers and defenses in place.

But tanks sitting still on a road, packed closely together, like those we saw in the infamous 40-mile convoy at the beginning of the war aren't intimidating at all. They are targets, and now many of them are scrap heaps of twisted steel and limp tracks and crooked turrets, all because a foot soldier carrying a 25-pound missile launcher was able to sneak up close enough to fire a warhead that cost less than one percent of the cost of the tank. Those kinds of figures, as they say, are not sustainable. Nor is the tank as a weapon of modern war.

The Russian government has accused the Ukrainian military of carrying out a cross-border raid targeting a fuel depot in the city of Belgorod using Mi-24 Hind attack helicopters. At least one Ukrainian official now appears to have denied this claim, after others had declined to comment one way or another. If Ukrainian forces did carry out this operation, it would be the first time that manned hostile aircraft have struck Russian territory since at least the Korean War. You can read more about what we know about this still very murky incident here.

This comes as Russia's force posture in the northeastern end of Ukraine continues to shift amid an apparent effort to reinvigorate offensives in the southeast. In the meantime, Ukrainian units continue to counterattack in multiple areas, notably retaking a growing number of towns in the vicinity of the capital Kyiv. Real progress on any kind of negotiated resolution to the war remains elusive.

The Ukrainian government continues to make appeals to various countries for additional military aid to help keep Russian forces at bay, and maybe even push them back further. Just today, German authorities announced that they had cleared a planned transfer of 56 Pbv-501 infantry fighting vehicles, which are upgraded ex-East German BMP-1s, from the Czech Republic to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other officials in his country, has been publicly asking for more tanks and other heavy armored vehicles, as well as anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and other weapons and equipment, to keep up the resistance against Russia's invasion.

The Latest

POSTED: 4:50 PM EST—

The German government's approval of the transfer of the 56 Pbv-501s to Ukraine reportedly came after an earlier request from Czech authorities was denied. The need for authorities in Germany to authorize the deal at all is a product of the original sale of these Soviet-era vehicles, which it had inherited from the defunct East German military, to Sweden. The Swedish government had then sold them to the Czech Republic. There are reports that these will need to be refurbished to some degree before they can return to service.

Even before the sale to Sweden, the German military had already made modifications to these Soviet-supplied BMP-1s to bring them up to Western safety standards, redesignating them BMP-1A1 Osts in the process. The first versions of the BMP-1 entered Soviet service in 1966. The German modifications most notably included modifications to prevent the fuel tanks built into the doors at the rear of the troop compartment from being filled.

The Swedish military, which applied their own designateon to these vehicles, Pbv-501, put them through another upgrade program after purchasing them. This included modifications to the engine and drive train, and the removal of asbestos from inside the vehicle, as well as other improvements.

The Pbv-501s retain the BMP-1's original turret, which contains a 73mm 2A28 gun and a coaxial 7.62x54mmR PKT machine gun. However, a guided anti-tank missile launch system that had been originally being integrated into the turret, was removed from these vehicles as part of the various upgrade programs.

The Ukrainian military, as well as that of Russia, continues to operate BMP-1-series vehicles. As such, it should be relatively easy to integrate these additional examples into their forces. If there are any issues in getting any of them back into an operational condition, they could still severe as useful sources of spare parts, too. These vehicles could be a boon to Ukrainian forces, which have already lost some of their existing stocks of BMP-1s in combat with Russian invaders.

As already noted, Ukrainian President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have been publicly asking for additional tanks and other amored vehicles to help replenish those lost in combat so far. There have also been appeals for other weapons, including more ground-based air defenses, which remain critical to the Ukrainian military's ability to contest the skies over the country.

The video below emerged just today and reportedly shows a dramatic shootdown of a Russian Mi-28N Havoc attack helicopter using a surface-to-air missile, possibly a shoulder-fired type, also known as a man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS). The helicopter's tail boom appears to almost, if not entirely separate from the main fuselage after it is hit.

The U.K. Ministry of Defense has assessed that Russian forces are continuing to carry out air and missile strikes across northeastern Ukraine, despite official pledges to de-escalate operations there earlier this week. Ukrainian units have been counterattacking with some degree of success in these areas, too.

The video in the Tweet below reportedly shows a salvo launch of Russian Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles at targets in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region.

As Ukrainian forces have regained control of various towns around Kyiv, new imagery has emerged showing the devastation in these areas. New video clips showing the extensive damage to Hostomel (Gostomel) Airport outside of the Ukrainian capital, as well as wrecked vehicles and other remnants of war now there, continue to emerge. This airfield had been the site of major fighting for weeks, as Russian forces tried and failed to secure it for use as an airborne bridgehead. It had been home to the only flying example of the An-225 Mriya cargo plane, one of the largest aircraft ever built, which has now been destroyed.

At least some Russian forces still remain in the greater Kyiv area, according to the U.S. government. A senior U.S. official specifically highlighted the apparent use of a church and adjacent residential areas northwest of Kyiv as a potential staging point for continued operations.

Russian forces have been observed stepping up their operations in the southeast of Ukraine. This includes a surge in air strikes. The undated video below reportedly shows a Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft operating at very low level over the eastern Donetsk region.

The Russian Ministry of Defense released the video below, which it says shows a Bastion-P ground-based anti-ship missile system belonging to the country's Black Sea Fleet being used in a secondary land-attack role. Russian officials say that the missile successfully hit a Ukrainian command post at an unspecified location, but have provided no further corroborating evidence.

The Red Cross says it tried to help additional civilians evacuate from the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, but was unsuccessful. Russian forces have subjected Mariupol to a devastating siege for weeks now, but still have yet to fully secure it. Local Ukrainian authorities say that 90 percent of the city's hospitals and schools have suffered at least some damage and 40 percent of the city, as a whole, has been destroyed.

The videos in the Tweets below reportedly show Ukrainian forces employing small commercially available unmanned aerial systems being used to help direct and adjust artillery fire against Russian units. Volunteer territorial defense units, including one associated with the far-right ultranationalist Right Sector group, are among those employing these tactics.

Video footage has emerged online showing Ukrainian forces moving land mines off a portion of a highway that stretches from Kyiv to the Polish border with their feet. This appears to be the same array of mines seen in a clip that had emerged earlier showing civilian drivers simply maneuvering around them. Though this definitely seems to be a less than optimal ""demining"" method, these mines appear to be TM-62 or similar anti-tank mines that require hundreds of pounds of pressure to trigger, making them at least somewhat safer to handle.

Ukrainian forces damaged what appears to be a PPRU-1 Ovod-M-SV, a radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle, in an ambush near the city of Chernihiv. This is a relatively rare find that could have significant potential intelligence value just like examples of the 9S932-1 MRU-B, another radar-equipped air defense command post vehicle, part of the Barnaul-T system, that elements of Ukraine's armed forces have captured or otherwise stumbled across in recent weeks, as you can read more about here.

Ukrainian forces have also reportedly captured another Russian TOS-1A multiple rocket launcher system. This is a particularly devastating weapon that fires 220mm thermobaric artillery rockets, as you can read more about here.

Russian forces are now reportedly employing Uran-6 unmanned mine-clearing vehicles in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Zelensky has said he has fired two senior members of the country's Security Service, also known by the acronym SBU, over apparent treason. He added that there are other similar individuals left to ""be punished.""

In Russia, online flight tracking software picked up an interesting flight involving a helicopter belonging to the Rossiya Special Flight Detachment. The helicopter departed from an area north of Moscow and then made a short trip to a facility belonging to the country's Federal Protective Service, or FSO.

We will continue to update this post with new information until we state otherwise.

The list of weapons in addition to the extremely interesting Switchblade Tactical UAS, contains several other items that can qualitatively affect the balance of power on the battlefield - Defense Express estimates.

Puma Unmanned Aerial System

These include Puma Unmanned Aerial Systems and Laser-guided rocket systems. Some people even far from the military sphere may have a question: why the United States is handing over the drones to Ukraine, the One that Ukrainian Armed Forces allegedly has enough. But Puma UAS has one extremely important feature.

Note that Puma UAS by AeroVironment is quite a well-known drone, which has already had been produced in batch of more than 1,000 units. The UAS is in service in 18 countries of the World - except the United States, Britain, Germany and France has the system in service.

Puma LE Unmanned Aerial System

In general, this is a small, classic UAV, which, at first glance, has no difference with dozens and hundreds of competitors. Even its characteristics are not surprising: 20 km range (up to 60 km using the additional LRTA communication system) and 5.5-6.5 hours in the air.

However, the main thing is really in the details. It differs from other UAVs by the presence of a suspended Mantis i45 gimbal sensor. This system, both in the daytime and thermal imaging versions, is equipped with a laser illuminator.

AeroVironment’s Mantis i45 gimbal delivers lightweight, compact and powerful visual awareness to the Puma AE™ small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operator and supports an advanced suite of sensors, including ultra high-resolution EO and IR imagers

It makes it possible to use the most common type of high-precision weapons in the United States – missiles and rockets using guided laser beams.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine has the only drone with such a system in the service - Bayraktar TB2 UAS. Therefore, the appearance of an additional drone of ""lower"" level is not superfluous. Especially since laser-guided rockets are also going to be delivered to Ukraine in the same military aid package.

APKWS or Hellfire II

It should be emphasized at once that the US Department of Defense has not named a specific system of missile weapons with laser guidance. The original document used the term “Laser-guided rocket systems”.

And for the definition of weapons, most likely, the key word should be “rocket”, because it severely limits the list of weapons. Most majority of the vehicles used in the United States use the term missile. For example, the Hellfire II is a missile.

Launch of Hellfire II with semi-active laser homing guidance system with Multi Mission Launcher

But the Hydra 70 unguided rocket projectile is already a “rocket”. And the only program to convert the one into a laser-guided missile system is the AGR-20 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) by BAE Systems.

APKWS is actually a module that is installed in Hydra-70 rocket system

But it should be noted at once that APKWS in practice was actively used only by air platforms - aircraft and helicopters. Its integration into Ukrainian aircraft is quite a difficult task.

However, in 2020, BAE conducted a series of successful experiments with the launch of APKWS from terrestrial platforms.

The result is a rather interesting ground-based high-precision ground-to-ground system.

Therefore, as one of the options, Ukraine may become the first country in the World where the system will be used in a real battlefield. This will make it even easier for russians to die on Ukrainian soil because of their aggression.",https://en.defence-ua.com/analysis/us_military_assistance_for_ukraine_puma_uas_and_laser_guided_rocket_systems_in_the_batch_as_mortal_mix_for_russian_troops-2441.html
