Live updates on Ukraine-Russia conflict

His statement came hours after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was no longer pressing for NATO’s membership for his country, a delicate issue that was one of Russia's stated reasons for invading its pro-Western neighbour.

""I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that ... NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview.

""The alliance is afraid of controversial things, and confrontation with Russia,"" the President added.

Meanwhile, Russian forces intensified their bombardment of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, the US said. Residents of the northeastern city of Sumy fled west in buses, a train and their own vehicles, taking advantage of humanitarian corridors.

4,9d8667f7-d303-4ade-93f1-cdced0151c64,[],2022-03-08 00:00:00,"STUTTGART, Germany — NATO’s top official on Tuesday acknowledged indications that the Russian military is committing war crimes in Ukraine by targeting civilians, which is contributing to Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War II.

“There are very credible reports of civilians coming under fire as they try to evacuate. Targeting civilians is a war crime, and it is totally unacceptable,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said during a stop in Riga, Latvia for high-level talks.

In recent days, news organizations and social media posts have shared images of residential areas cratered by missiles and civilian deaths in the streets of several of Ukraine’s cities.

Stoltenberg called on Russia to allow for humanitarian corridors to allow safe passage of civilians. Russia proposed some civilian evacuation routes Tuesday, according to Russian state media, but Ukrainian officials rejected several of them for leading to Russia or its ally, Belarus.

So far, more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine for border countries such as Poland, Slovakia and Romania since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly two weeks ago.

Stoltenberg’s comments, made ahead of talks Tuesday with the prime ministers of Latvia, Canada and Spain at a NATO battlegroup base in Latvia, came as the alliance continues to assess ways to further reinforce its territory in Russia’s periphery.

Since Russia’s new invasion into Ukraine, the U.S. and other allies have increased the numbers of forces up and down NATO’s eastern flank, including in Latvia. Late last month, 300 soldiers with the Vicenza, Italy-based 173rd Airborne Brigade were dispatched to the Baltic state to enhance defenses.

Thousands of other U.S. troops also have taken up positions in Poland, Romania and Germany.

Still, allies in the Baltics have been vocal about wanting more NATO presence.

On Monday, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda made the point directly to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a meeting in Vilnius.

“Antony, I must say deterrence is no longer enough, and we need more defense here, because otherwise it will be too late,” Nauseda said. “Putin will not stop in Ukraine; he will not stop.”

What such a shift — from deterrence to defense — would entail isn’t yet clear, but last week Stoltenberg said NATO is considering a significant troop increase in the region.

Meanwhile, Stoltenberg on Tuesday said allies remain committed to “defending every inch” of alliance territory.

As the Russian’s invasion on Ukrainian soil enters day 14, Volodomyr Zelensky has taken the biggest ever u-turn by saying that he is no longer interested in NATO membership. Expressing Ukraine’s willingness to compromise over the status of two break-away pro-Russian territories, Zelensky appeared to waive a white flag in his latest interview.

On the issue of Ukraine seeking NATO membership, Zelensky said that he cooled down regarding this question a long time ago as he has understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine. Alleging that NATO is afraid of controversial things and confrontation with Russia, the Ukrainian President added that he does not want to be the president of a country, which is begging on its knees.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

Russian forces bombarded the Ukrainian city Mariupol again on Thursday amid international outrage over the bombing of a children's hospital there, while a massive convoy that has been stalled for over a week outside Kyiv appeared to split up into surrounding towns and forests.

Civilians in the port city of Mariupol are facing increasingly dire conditions with scarce food, fuel and electricity. Bodies are being buried in mass graves.

The Kremlin displayed harried confusion in its response to criticism Thursday, at times completely denying the Mariupol hospital bombing and at other moments alleging an elaborate propaganda ploy by the West.

Photos and video of the bombing's aftermath clearly show severely injuried people - including a pregnant woman - being taken by stretcher from the rubble.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, has said the building was a hospital and called the attack an ""atrocity.""

The hospital complex in Mariupol bombed Wednesday resulted in at least three deaths, including one child, Ukraine authorities say. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the claim Thursday, saying the hospital had been emptied of patients and was being used as an extremist base.

The attack was condemned internationally and branded a ""war crime"" by Ukrainian and Western leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron called it “a shameful and immoral act of war.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said it was ""horrific"" and ""barbaric.""

""This is not the first time when we see pathetic cries about so-called atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces,"" Lavrov said. ""Our delegation presented facts at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council proving that the maternity hospital had long been seized by fighters of the Azov battalion and other radicals. They kicked all patients, all nurses, and all service personnel out.""

VISUALS:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Later, Russia denied responsibility entirely and claimed the attack was staged to make the Kremlin look bad. Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov denied the strike. He claimed that the two explosions that ravaged the building were caused by explosive devices planted nearby in what he described as a “staged provocation to incite anti-Russian agitation in the West.”

Meanwhile, the highest-level talks yet failed to reach agreement on a humanitarian cease-fire aimed at protecting Ukraine cities battered by fierce Russian assaults.

In Poland, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the U.S. commitment to NATO and defense of its members is ""ironclad."" Harris, during a joint news conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda, said America is deeply appreciative of Poland's efforts to aid refugees fleeing the carnage in Ukraine.

""This is a moment that requires severe and swift consequences for Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" Harris said. ""What is at stake, this very moment, are some of the guiding principles around the NATO alliance.""

The meeting came after the Biden administration rejected a plan from Poland that would involve U.S. involvement in providing fighter jets to Ukraine, a decision drawing questions from some Republican senators. U.S. defense officials also have distanced themselves from Ukraine requests for a NATO-backed no-fly zone over the country.

In Turkey, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov met, the most pressing issue the southern port of Mariupol. The city has been rocked by two weeks of unrelenting bombardment leaving inhabitants struggling to obtain, food, water, shelter and other basic necessities. Multiple rounds of talks aimed at protecting Ukraine's civilians have also failed to make headway toward peace.

Latest developments:

► Congress passed $13.6 billion in humanitarian aid money for Ukraine and allies as part of a larger spending package that received bipartisan support in the Senate on Thursday.

►In addition to the more than 2.3 million people who have fled the war in Ukraine, an estimated 1.9 million people are displaced within the country, according to the U.N.

►Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off sanctions from the West, saying they are nothing new for Russians. ″Just as we overcame these difficulties in the previous years, we will overcome them now,"" he said at a televised meeting of government officials. He acknowledged the sanctions create “certain challenges.”

►Former Vice President Mike Pence and wife Karen visited Thursday with Ukraine refugees at the Korczowa border crossing in Poland. ""The impact of the Russian invasion on these families is heartbreaking and the need for support is great,"" Pence said on Twitter.

►The U.N. refugee agency says more than 2.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country, over 1.4 million of them through Poland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Thursday that about 100,000 people have fled over the last two days through evacuation corridors.

►A Ukrainian man learned his family was killed through graphic images circulating on Twitter. Serhiy Perebyinis told The New York Times he first recognized the luggage in the photo where the lifeless bodies of his wife and two children were lying on the ground after being hit by shrapnel from a Russian mortar shelling Sunday.

Biden to call for suspending Russia's preferential trade status over Ukraine

President Joe Biden will announce Friday the U.S. will join the European Union and G7 allies in calling to revoke Russia's permanent normal trade relations status, which would allow new tariffs on Russian imports, according to a source familiar with the decision.

The move, which requires congressional action, comes as a group of bipartisan lawmakers has pressured the president to take more aggressive action to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The source said Biden looks forward to working with Congress on legislation to revoke Russia's permanent normal trade relations status.

Biden's expected announcement would put Moscow's trade relationship with the U.S. in the same category as North Korea and Cuba. Read more here.

Zelenskyy worries Russia could use chemical or bioweapons in Ukraine

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied Russia’s accusation that Ukraine is preparing to attack with chemical or biological weapons, and he said the accusation itself was a bad sign.

“That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said in his nightly address to the nation.

Russia said it uncovered plans to create secret laboratories in Ukraine to produce biological weapons.

“I am a reasonable person. The president of a reasonable country and reasonable people. I am the father of two children,” Zelenskyy said. “And no chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

His comments came as the U.S. and other Western leaders expressed similar concerns that Russia was hinting as its possible next move in using such weapons in the war in Ukraine.

Nuclear research facility hit by Russian shelling

Russian forces shelled a nuclear research institute in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city on Thursday, setting buildings ablaze, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry.

A shell hit a building where there is equipment that could release radiation if it were damaged, Gerashchenko said. According to the president’s office, there has been no change in the background radiation.

The shelling caused a fire, but firefighters were able to put it out.

Russian forces have already taken over two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, raising concerns about the security of nuclear facilities in the country.

State Department vows to hold Russians responsible for war crimes

The United States has seen “very credible reports” of deliberate attacks by Russians on Ukrainian civilians that would qualify as a war crime under international law, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday.

That could include the recent assault on the maternity and children’s hospital complex as well as strikes on schools, residential buildings, public buses and ambulances, he said. Price said the U.S. will do everything possible to hold accountable every Russian political leader, military commander and service member who participates in a war crime.

“Criminal prosecutions are one possibility,” he said.

The U.S. has the ability to conduct its own in-depth investigations and will support the appropriate international investigations, Price said. The International Criminal Court announced last week it’s investigating possible war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. Price was also pushed on the administration’s rejection of Poland’s offer to transfer Soviet-era fighter planes to the U.S., which could then give the planes to Ukraine.

Price repeated the administration’s argument that having the planes pass through U.S. hands would risk escalating the war. Asked if the U.S. would still support the original goal of having Poland transfer its planes directly to Ukraine, Price said that’s up to Poland.

“Individual NATO allies, individual countries are going to make sovereign decisions on what… they deem to be in their best interest,” he said.

Twitter to start labeling Belarus state media content

Twitter announced Thursday it will label accounts and tweets linked to state media content in Belarus, a Russian ally. The move comes after the company launched labels on Kremlin-linked media accounts last week.

""As is standard with these labels, we’ll reduce the visibility of labeled Tweets and accounts, and show a prompt before you can share labeled Tweets,"" said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity.

Roth said adding labels to Russian state media has shown a decrease of 30% in impressions on its content.

Big tech companies have had to grapple with how to approach state media and propaganda. Google said it would block YouTube channels linked to Russian state media. Read more here.

Some U.S. universities cutting financial, academic ties to Russia

Some public American universities with investments in Russia are cutting financial and academic ties to the country following its invasion of Ukraine, including all of Arizona’s public universities.

“Obviously we see the invasion of Ukraine as the actions of a mad despot and so we want to do as little as possible to help him in any possible way,” said Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University, one of the largest public institutions in the country.

Similar actions have been taken by the Texas A & M University and the University of Colorado systems.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology also recently cut ties to a Russian university it helped launch, and Middlebury College withdrew students that had been studying in the country.

Ukrainian man discovers family was killed after seeing Twitter post

A Ukrainian man waited to hear that his wife and children had safely evacuated to Kyiv amid the Russian invasion. Hours later, he learned his family was killed through graphic images circulating on Twitter.

Serhiy Perebyinis told The New York Times he first recognized the luggage in the photo where the lifeless bodies of his wife, Tetiana Perebyinis, 43, and their two children, Mykyta, 18, and Alisa, 9, and church volunteer Anatoly Berezhnyi, 26, were laying on the ground after being hit by shrapnel from a Russian mortar shelling on Sunday.

They were attempting to cross a bridge to safety when the mortar detonated 12 yards away from the family in the town of Irpin. Serhiy told the outlet he was in eastern Ukraine trying to help his sick mother when Tetiana decided it was time to flee to Kyiv.

“I told her, ‘Forgive me that I couldn’t defend you,’” he said. “I tried to care for one person, and it meant I cannot protect you.”

Ukrainian Paralympic athletes protest at China games

Ukrainian athletes at the Paralympics Games in China held a demonstration on Thursday at the Athletes Village, donning blue and yellow and holding a large banner that read, ""Peace For All.""

The group held a minute of silence and called for peace before noting how personally impacted they have been by the war. Andriy Nesterenko, the head coach of the delegation, noted how members of their team were from areas that have been ravaged by the war. He said ""some of them doesn’t have the possibility to come back. Their flats, their private houses are already destroyed,"" he told reporters at the demonstration, according to The New York Times.

Already, a Ukrainian biathlete had to withdraw from a competition at the games after her father was captured by Russian troops. Anastasiia Laletina did not race in the biathlon middle distance sitting event Tuesday after she heard her father, a soldier in the Ukrainian army was taken prisoner by Russian soldiers, team spokesperson Nataliia Harach confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday. He was beaten and being treated by doctors.

The games barred Russia from competing in the games, citing tensions in the Athletes Village. The Russian Paralympic Committee called the decision “absolutely politicized.”

Republicans attack Biden’s handling of Polish fighter jet proposal

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday attacked what he called the Biden administration’s “confusing mismanagement and mixed signals” on the Ukraine crisis. The Kentucky Republican was referring to the Polish government’s surprise offer this week to give its Soviet-era fighter jets to the U.S., which would then give the planes to Ukraine. The administration, which had anticipated Poland would directly provide the planes to Ukraine, called Poland’s offer “untenable.” Involving the U.S. and a NATO air base would run a “high risk” of escalating the war, the Pentagon said Wednesday.

At least a dozen senators urged the Biden administration to reconsider. Some accused the White House of abandoning an ally in its time of need, while others implored it to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin or risk having him try to conquer other U.S. allies – or even America itself. Republican senators continued to rail against the administration at a press conference Thursday afternoon.

“I just want to let people know that on March the sixth, the United States policy was green-lighting MiGs to Ukraine if Poland did it. Now that Poland's asked us to be part of the transfer system, we all of a sudden say no,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “And here's what breaks my heart. This is dishonorable. It's one thing to be incompetent. It's another thing to be dishonorable.”

Fellow Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the U.S. isn't sending the right message to Putin. “If we continue to blink every time Vladimir Putin says ‘Boo,’ he's not going to stop in Ukraine, he's not going to stop in Europe,” Cotton said.

CIA chief: Putin can’t ‘bottle up the truth indefinitely’

Russian President Vladimir Putin has masked the costs of the Ukraine invasion in his own country through the dominance of state media and the “strangulation of independent media” but won’t be able to hide the truth indefinitely, according to CIA Director William Burns. Burns, a former ambassador to the Russian federation, told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that many Russians have virtual private network accounts and retain access to YouTube and other sources of independent information.

As the damage mounts, Burns said Putin’s propaganda bubble would be punctured by the number of troops killed and wounded, the economic consequences of a worldwide trade embargo and the horrific scenes of hospitals and schools being bombed.

“I don’t believe that he is going to be able to seal Russians off entirely from the truth,” Burns said. “I don’t think he can bottle up the truth indefinitely.”

Haines: ‘No evidence’ Ukraine is pursuing biological, nuclear weapons

Ukraine is not pursuing biological or nuclear weapons, as Russia has falsely spread through propaganda, the top U.S. intelligence official told a Senate panel Thursday.

Russia has accused the U.S. of sponsoring biological weapons research in Ukraine since invading the neighboring country two weeks ago. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, accused Ukraine of preparing a chemical attack. Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, testified that Ukraine has a dozen biological research labs developing countermeasures and how to prevent the spread of pandemics, but not weapons labs.

“I want to be absolutely clear that we do not believe that Ukraine is pursuing biological or nuclear weapons. We’ve seen no evidence of that,” Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “This influence campaign is completely consistent with longstanding Russian efforts to accuse the United States of sponsoring bio weapons work in the former Soviet Union. This is a classic move by the Russians.”

Borislav Bereza, former member of Ukrainian parliament and member of Ukrainian delegation in Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, posted a statement on social media warning that Russia could have a dangerous motive: ""This is actually an announcement and confession that Russia is planning to use chemical weapons in the near future.""

Harris: UN will investigate Russian assault on hospital

Vice President Kamala Harris said Russia’s airstrikes on hospitals were “atrocities of unimaginable proportion” and said the United Nations has a process to review and investigate to investigate such attacks. The World Health Organization says at least 18 attacks have been conducted on medical facilities since the invasion began Feb. 24.

Harris noted that “the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”

Ukraine said Russian bombs severely damaged a maternity and children's hospital complex in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday, killing at least three people including a child and wounding at least 17 more.

“Russians are committing war crimes,"" Polish President Duda said. “I hope that also in the future, it will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears responsibility for that.""

Kyiv mayor: Half the city has fled

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Thursday that about 2 million people – half the population of the capital’s metropolitan area – have fled the city amid constant bombings from the Russian military. But he said the spirit of the city remains strong. Fighting is fierce, and the city has become a fortress, he said.

“Everyone says 'Nothing will happen, we will not surrender our city,'"" Klitschko said. ""I can repeat these words: The city stood, the people will stand. They won't give up. And the enemy won't pass.""

World champion British soccer team, owned by Russian, hit with sanctions

Roman Abramovich's attempt to sell British soccer team Chelsea has been halted after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the U.K. government. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Chelsea's value at $3.2 billion. Abramovich put the team up for sale last week, shortly before his assets were frozen.

The team cannot sell game tickets or merchandise. The British government is allowing the team to play its games, including one scheduled for Thursday night. Ticket-holders will be allowed to attend matches and staff will be paid. Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and aluminum, has not condemned Russia’s invasion.

Suffering increases for Ukrainians

Ukrainian leaders say civilians are increasingly suffering and dying as Russia's assault on Ukraine enters its third week. Multiple hospitals have been shelled, more than 2.3 million people have fled the country and more are struggling to leave. On the outskirts of Kyiv, hundreds of residents in towns occupied by Russian troops fled Wednesday. Some said they hadn't eaten in days, while others told harrowing tales of war.

Zelenskyy calls hospital bombing ‘war crime’

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy has described the attack on a children’s hospital in the southeastern city of Mariupol as a “war crime” after it prompted international condemnation.

“We have not done and would never do anything like this war crime in any of the cities of the Donetsk or Luhansk regions, or of any region … because we are people. But are you?” Zelenskyy said, switching to Russian to make his point.

“What kind of a country is Russia, that it is afraid of hospitals and maternity wards and destroys them?” he said. “The air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof. Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place.”

Zelenskyy also reiterated his call for Western powers to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to prevent more attacks.

“Together we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves,” he said.

IMF approves $1.4bn emergency funding for Ukraine

The International Monetary Fund has said its executive board approved $1.4bn in emergency financing for Ukraine to help meet urgent spending needs and mitigate the economic effect of Russia’s military invasion.

“The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said, predicting a deep recession in Ukraine this year.

“Financing needs are large, urgent and could rise significantly as the war continues,” she said. Once the war was over, Ukraine was likely to need additional “large support”.

The global lender said Ukrainian authorities had cancelled an existing stand-by lending arrangement with the IMF, but would work with the fund to design an appropriate economic programme focused on rehabilitation and growth when conditions permit.

White House dismisses Russia’s claims of US involvement in biological warfare labs

The White House has said Russia’s claims about alleged US involvement in biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine were false.

“We took note of Russia’s false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a series of tweets.

She said Russia could possibly be laying the groundwork for the use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine “or to create a false flag operation using them” but did not offer evidence.

We took note of Russia’s false claims about alleged U.S. biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine. We’ve also seen Chinese officials echo these conspiracy theories. — Jen Psaki (@PressSec) March 9, 2022

Ukrainian MP says people forced to drink ‘contaminated water’

Ukrainian Member of Parliament Lesia Vasylenko says it is currently impossible for many Ukrainians to access clean water amid the fighting, forcing many to drink contaminated water and causing several cases of dehydration.

“It’s impossible to get food or water,” Vasylenko told Al Jazeera. “People are drinking contaminated water from the sewage system or children are forced to take snow or what remains of the snow just to stay hydrated.”

The situation, she added, demonstrates “how inhumane” the methods Russia is using against the Ukrainian civilian population are.

UN humanitarian chief decries strike on hospital as ‘deeply shocking’

The UN’s humanitarian affairs chief has denounced the attack on a Ukrainian children’s hospital in Mariupol as an “appalling breach” of international humanitarian law.

“It’s deeply shocking in all kinds of different ways. It’s shocking because it’s a medical facility, which under international humanitarian law is protected,” Martin Griffiths told Al Jazeera.

“It’s shocking because it kills babies, newborns and it’s shocking because this is the kind of thing that happens appallingly in the war like the one we are seeing in Ukraine.

He added: “I hope we will find out in due course who did this and hold them to account.”

Pentagon does not support more jets for Ukraine

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has informed his Polish counterpart that Washington does not back Warsaw’s plans to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to Ukraine, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby has said.

He said the effectiveness of Russia’s “significant” air force has already been limited by Ukraine’s air defences.

“Polish generosity is clearly on display for the whole world to see,” Kirby said. “But at this time, we believe that provision of additional fighter aircraft provides little increased capabilities at high risk.”

He added that transferring the jets to Ukraine would risk an escalation with Russia.
