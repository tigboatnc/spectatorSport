The video which seems to have been shot by a resident of the city from his window is is a part of Russia's ongoing offences against the country in Chernihiv. This comes at a time when the Ukrainian government has been accusing the Russians of using cluster bombs for carrying out massive explosions in the country. However, the severity of this bomb is yet to be known.

In the video exclusively accessed by Republic, the bomb explodes around the early morning hours and further transforms into a big explosion turning the entire sky orange. Also, huge plumes of smoke and heavy sounds are witnessed from the attack site.

This came just a day after Russian troops have been intensely bombarding residential areas killing dozens of people. As per reports, the attacks on the residential areas resulted in the death of 22 civilians including men and women, while more are said to be stuck under the debris. Apartment buildings, windows, walls, roofs, balconies, ceilings, and other things were also damaged in the explosions.

Russian forces launch massive attacks in Chernihiv

On Thursday, the Chernihiv's Regional State Administration had confirmed that the Russian forces had launched a missile strike on a multi-story residential area in the city centre causing major damage. Apart from that, it had also shelled an oil depot in Chernihiv's ""Kombinat Aystra,"" causing a massive fire in a 5,000 cu m diesel fuel tank. This came after the Ukrainian military had destroyed Russia's military vehicles in Chernihiv on Wednesday.

Videos of the explosion and its aftermath was recorded by several people and were extensively shared on social media. Chernihiv which is the city of 2,85,000 people located in the north of Kyiv has recently become the centre of attack indicating the advancement of Russian troops into the capital city.

Explosions have rocked Ukraine's capital Kyiv overnight amid widespread uncertainty over whether Russia will launch a full assault on the capital in the coming hours and days. Massive blasts were heard and filmed in the city last night, with one video on social media showing a huge fireball rising in the city's sky. It's unknown what the targets of the explosions were, or whether there have been casualties caused by the blasts. NBC News is working to verify camera footage posted online purporting to show explosions hitting the city. More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the Russian invasion a week ago, but many have stayed and taken up arms to fight Russian forces. Many of Kyiv's residents, including children, also remain in the city, living or seeking shelter in subway stations, basements and underground bunkers when air raid sirens warn of incoming strikes.

Russia has said Kyiv's residents will be allowed to evacuate the city in the direction of Vasylkiv, to the southwest of the city. ""There will not be any obstacles from Russian military personnel for the exit of the civilian population,"" Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, said on Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency TASS. This is the second time that Russia has warned Kyiv's residents to leave the city, with Konashenkov insisting on Monday that the route toward Vasylkiv was ""open and safe,"" despite reports of Russian missile strikes on the town.

The convoy

As many residents of Kyiv take shelter in underground stations and bunkers, the decision of whether to stay or go — and to risk possible harm and death in the process of leaving — has become acute this week, particularly as concerns grow that Russia could be poised to launch an all-out assault on the city. Fears have grown after satellite images emerged at the start of the week showing a huge convoy of Russian military vehicles, estimated to be around 40 miles long, slowly snaking its way toward the capital. The following satellite image was taken by U.S firm Maxar Technologies on Monday. It appears to show a convoy of Russian armored tanks and trucks that stretched from Pybirsk, further north of Kyiv, to the Antonov airport (also known as the Hostomel airport — the site of fighting last week between Russian and Ukrainian forces) on the northwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

The convoy has reportedly been held up on its way to Kyiv, however, amid unconfirmed reports of food and fuel shortages. When asked about the convoy's progress and position at a press briefing on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Department Spokesman John Kirby said ""we still assess that that convoy, but more broadly speaking the northern push by the Russians down towards the south, towards Kyiv, remains stalled."" ""From our best estimates have not made any appreciable progress geographically speaking in the last 24 to 36 hours,"" he added. The U.S. defense official believed there were several reasons for the delay: ""One, we believe the Russians are deliberately, actually, regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up for lost time. Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistics and sustainment challenges, challenges that we don't believe they fully anticipated."" Lastly, he said, Russian forces have experienced ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" with indications — although the U.S. could not completely independently verify them — that ""Ukrainians have in fact tried to slow down that convoy."" Britain's Ministry of Defense confirmed the United States' assessment of the convoy on Thursday, issuing an intelligence update in which it said ""the main body of the large Russian column … remains over 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion."" The ministry also believed that ""the column has made little discernible progress in over three days."" Jack Watling, a research fellow for land warfare and military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said there were a number of logistical challenges that the convoy faces. ""When you have that many vehicles on a very small number of roads you need to move fuel and food and large quantities of it along that road so you're continually having to move the vehicles aside and then at the other end you're having to work who's going to go where and what they're going to do,"" he said. ""So I think the Russians are trying to sort themselves out, as it were, and shake out at the other end and prepare for what they want to do to Kyiv,"" he told the BBC's ""Today"" program on Thursday.

Dire situation

Kyiv is only one of the a number of key cities that Russian forces are hoping to seize following their invasion of Ukraine. Other key strategic cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have been the scenes of fierce fighting. There are reports that Russian forces have taken control of Kherson in the south, with the city's mayor announcing on Facebook Wednesday evening that Russians had imposed a curfew and other rules on residents. The mayor, Igor Kolykhayev, warned residents not to provoke the Russian military.

Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of Ukraine’s biggest cities, officials said, raining rockets on residential areas and killing at least 21 people in the eastern city of Kharkiv and four in the western city of Zhytomyr.

The deaths, reported early on Wednesday, came as Ukrainian authorities said another five people had been killed in a Russian attack on a television tower in the capital, Kyiv.

The attacks on urban areas signal a shift of Russian tactics amid Western assessments that Moscow’s six-day invasion had stalled. They raised fears the invading troops may now fall back on tactics that call for a crushing bombardment of built-up areas before trying to enter them.

Oleh Sinehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, said that Russian shelling and bombing of various locations in Ukraine’s second biggest city had killed at least 21 people and wounded 112.

“Fires due to the air raids are still being eliminated, shells are being detonated,” he said.

Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on his Telegram channel that a Russian cruise missile had hit residential areas in Zhytomyr, about 120km (75 miles) west of Kyiv.

The missile appeared aimed at a nearby base of the 95th Airborne Brigade in Zhytomyr.

It set several residential buildings on fire.

“So far, four people have died. Including a child,” he said.

Al Jazeera could not independently verify the figures.

The total number of casualties since the invasion began also remains unclear.

The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that it had confirmed 136 civilian deaths, including that of 13 children. Another 400 people were wounded, it said.

Ukraine’s health ministry has previously said 352 civilians had been killed during the Russian attack, as of Monday. The figure included 14 children, it said.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow.

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, describing it as a “special military operation” aimed at dislodging “neo-Nazis” ruling Ukraine.

But facing emboldened Ukrainian troops bolstered by citizen soldiers, Russia has failed to capture a single city since its full-scale invasion began nearly a week ago.

“Looking at the Russian operation so far, they’re having tremendous problems with logistics and communications. The whole effort seems shambolic,” Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at Washington’s Wilson Center, wrote in a tweet.

A miles-long armoured column bearing down on Kyiv also has not made any advances in the past 24 hours, according to a US defence official who spoke to the Reuters news agency, frozen in place by logistics problems, short on fuel and food, and perhaps pausing to reassess tactics.

The defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: “One reason why things appear to be stalled north of Kyiv is that the Russians themselves are regrouping and rethinking and trying to adjust to the challenges that they’ve had.”

The Russians have been surprised not only by the scale of Ukrainian resistance but also by poor morale among their own forces, some of whom surrendered without a fight, the official said, without providing evidence.

Many Western military analysts fear that Russia may be shifting tactics, and using artillery and air bombardments to pulverize cities to crush fighters’ resolve.

The United Kingdom’s defence ministry said it had seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days.

It also said three cities – Kharkiv, Kherson and Mariupol – were encircled by Russian forces.

Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, said it has documented a cluster bomb attack outside a hospital in Ukraine’s east in recent days.

Residents also reported the use of such weapons in Kharkiv, and Kiyanka village.

Cluster bombs shoot smaller “bomblets” over a large area, many of which fail to explode until long after they have been dropped. If their use is confirmed, that would represent a new level of brutality in the war and could lead to the further isolation of Russia.

The Kremlin denied using cluster bombs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/more-deaths-as-russia-intensifies-bombing-of-ukraine-cities

Footage captured in the city showed a massive, orange blast lighting up the night sky followed by a loud boom.

Local journalists reported that air raid alerts had been triggered throughout the night with residents urged to seek shelter.

One of the blasts, caught on camera by a CBS crew, cast a bright flash of orange light across the capital.

The presenter, who was forced to duck for cover after a second huge explosion followed within seconds, described it as “a big flash” and “almost like lightning”.

Another clip shared on social media showed what appeared to be an orange fireball erupt on the horizon.

Following heavy overnight shelling of the city, Russia's Defence Ministry said it had disabled a reserve broadcasting centre in the Lysa Hora district, in the south of the city.

It said unspecified precision weapons were used, and claimed there were no casualties or damage to residential buildings.

A statement from the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces didn't address the strikes, saying only that Russian forces were ""regrouping"" and ""trying to reach the northern outskirts"" of the city.

An explosion also rocked Kyiv’s railway station, where thousands of refugees are desperately trying to escape the city.

A Ukrainian interior ministry adviser said that blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. It was not immediately clear whether that was the same blast that caused the orange fireball to erupt.

However, despite another night of heavy bombing, the huge armoured column of Russian tanks and soldiers which is approaching Kyiv appeared to remain stalled outside the capital, having apparently run short on fuel, food and other supplies.

""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30 km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.

A senior US defence official confirmed the column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

""The advance on Kyiv has been rather not very organised and now they're more or less stuck,"" military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told the Associated Press news agency from Moscow.

CHERNIHIV, Ukraine — This city endured weeks of Russian siege, but just barely. Officials here, 90 miles north of Kyiv, buried hundreds of civilians in makeshift coffins and hastily dug trenches. Families held mass funerals, fearing they could be killed if they lingered in the cemetery. Water and electricity were almost entirely cut off, and no aid could come in.

More than half of the city’s prewar population of 300,000 fled. Those who stayed behind spent much of the last five weeks huddled underground as Russian forces pounded residential neighborhoods with missiles and mortar fire. The civilian death toll remains unclear, but Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said at times the city buried up to 100 people in a single day.

“They were not fighting the army here,” he said in an interview from his office in the city’s historic center, which was damaged when two missiles struck nearby on Feb. 27. “They were bombing civilians.”

Chernihiv, a regional capital, is the largest Ukrainian city besieged by Russian troops to come back under complete Ukrainian control, though residents are preparing for what they fear could be a Russian return in the coming days.

On Monday, the first day a route from Kyiv to Chernihiv reopened, Washington Post reporters interviewed local people who provided accounts of atrocities that echo those emerging in other cities Russians have occupied, from Kyiv’s suburbs to wide swaths of the country’s east and south that remain under Russian control.

Residents here described violence and brutality by soldiers that added to the growing litany of potential Russian war crimes committed during the war in Ukraine.

Russian troops arrived outside Chernihiv soon after the war’s start, only having to travel 45 miles by road from the border with Belarus, where they had been stationed. But the Ukrainian military managed to keep them outside the city, even though it was fully encircled.

Villages ringing Chernihiv became the front line. Locals said Russian troops repeatedly and indiscriminately deployed cluster munitions, and inflicted extreme brutality. On Monday, remnants of those weapons littered fields outside the city, alongside dozens of burned-out Russian and Ukrainian tanks and military transport vehicles.

Residents of one village near Chernihiv said that on Sunday and Monday they buried 12 civilians and that humanitarian workers removed more than 100 bodies, mostly of soldiers, both Russian and Ukrainian. They said most of the Russians were pulled from a century-old church they had been using as a place to sleep. It had been partially incinerated after a Ukrainian drone strike hit a pile of weapons next to it.

And in the city, where it was finally safe to do so, another 56 bodies were moved out of a morgue on Monday and buried in a trench.

Unlike in towns outside Kyiv such as Irpin and Bucha, where there is a sense that Russian forces have abandoned their push on the capital, officials in Chernihiv fear that Russian troops are simply regrouping and may soon be back at the city’s edge.

The last Russians left the city’s vicinity only a few days ago, said Viacheslav Chaus, the head of Chernihiv’s military administration. He added that the military was trying to quickly establish and secure aid and evacuation corridors that it was calling “roads of life,” in anticipation of a Russian return.

“We don’t have that feeling of peace or calm here because the Russians can come back as quickly as they left,” Atroshenko, the city’s mayor, said. “I don’t even understand the future of the war — whether this is the end of war for us or if we just need to repair water and electricity before another attack.”

The mayor was working in his third-floor office when a missile landed just outside.

His windows shattered, sending glass flying through the room. He dove to the floor before escaping outside. Another missile struck soon after. The two attacks damaged a children’s dentist’s office across the street and a historic cinema next door. The strikes also left Atroshenko convinced Russian forces intended to assassinate him.

On Monday, he surveyed the scene of damage outside his office and described how he now keeps his phone on airplane mode, to make it harder to track. He changes locations regularly and sleeps close to three bodyguards tasked with keeping him alive.

When he was first elected mayor in 2015, he never imagined his duties would include finding refrigerator trucks for morgues to preserve the unidentified dead. He never pictured Russian troops occupying the city’s main cemetery on its outskirts.

The strike on the mayor’s office came as Russians intensified their shelling, spurring many residents to flee to surrounding villages where they had extended family, hoping they might escape the worst of the battle for the city.

But facing stiff resistance, Russian troops were only able to encircle Chernihiv. That meant once-bucolic villages on the city’s perimeter, like tiny Lukashivka, were not a safe haven. Instead, they endured weeks of fierce artillery battles punctuated by Russian cluster bombing.

Cluster munitions, which disperse “bomblets” across a large area, are banned under a United Nations convention. So many cluster munition carriers littered the village that in the days since the Russians withdrew, residents had stacked them in piles.

By March 9, Lukashivka — former population 288 — had come under control of a Russian battalion led by a man known as Titan, who residents said terrorized them with vicious beatings and mock executions.

Alexey Pavliuk, 26, described one incident in which Titan and two other soldiers stormed into his house, dragged him and a friend into the backyard, hung them by their arms with rope from a tree branch and stripped them naked before pressing guns to their chests.

“It was below freezing, but I didn’t even notice,” Pavliuk said. “I was saying goodbye to life.”

The soldiers left them hanging while they rifled through Pavliuk’s house and stole everything of value, Pavliuk said. Then, unexpectedly, they cut the ropes.

The harassment became a daily routine. Residents said they were lined up and had their phones and passports confiscated. Others said Russian soldiers stole even their carpets and pillows.

“They put our mattresses on top of their tank and drove away with them,” Iryna Horbonos said. “After that we slept on the cold floor of our basement cellar for three weeks.”

Much of the violence was gratuitous.

As Russian losses in the village mounted, the violence against civilians worsened. Titan found Horbonos’s father-in-law, Anatoly, 70, walking one evening. Anatoly recalled how Titan forced him to guzzle from his vodka bottle, then slammed his rifle butt into his stomach twice, rendering the old man unconscious.

“We’ve lost 30 men today, so now you will suffer for it,” he remembered hearing Titan say before he lost consciousness.

On a cattle farm on the edge of the village that Russian troops took over from Ukrainians who had been using it as a defensive position, Titan’s men executed dozens of cows and calves, shooting them in their throats and eyes at point-blank range and even beheading some, leaving the heads in a pile. Residents described the killings as violence for its own sake.

The carcasses of the cattle had been rotting for a week before Olla Korobka entered their holding pen on Monday with Iryna Horbonos and her son, Nikita, 25. They rescued the only survivor, one barely alive calf stuck under the rubble.

“This is Titan’s work, too,” Korobka said.

Inside the city, as the siege dragged on, volunteers risked their lives to deliver water. Using a portable generator, they let desperate residents charge their phones to call family to confirm they were still alive. Despite their efforts, many residents died not only from shelling but because they were unable to access essential medicines, hospital employees said.

Many of those wounded in Russian attacks inside the city remain inside Chernihiv City Hospital No. 2 — their families often staying there with them because their homes were destroyed.

Bohdan Rozhylo, 40, who leads the hospital’s trauma unit, said the past month has been “the hardest of my life.”

His patients include Volodymyr Shyk, who on March 16 joined a queue of some 100 civilians waiting in line for bread. After around an hour of waiting, Shyk said, intense shelling hit the wall of the supermarket, throwing him to the ground. Shrapnel tore through his knee and broke his shin.

“I saw blood everywhere,” he said. “Twelve people didn’t stand up. They were killed instantly.” Bystanders helped evacuate him and dozens of others who were wounded to the hospital.

But even there, they had no respite.

The next day, Russian shelling and mortar fire struck the hospital, shattering windows and doors, filling the corridors with smoke and wounding some patients and staff in what hospital director Vladyslav Kukhar said he believes was an intentional attack. Russian forces have repeatedly struck hospitals throughout the country.

“I am 63 years old and have never witnessed such a thing,” Shyk said of the two attacks. “I would classify it as an atrocity against civilians.”

Medical workers picked shards of glass out of the faces, arms and legs of civilians wounded in the bread line. On Monday, the windows of the hospital remained boarded up and artillery damage was visible on the walls and ceilings inside.

The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a statement decrying the March 16 attack, accusing Russian forces of killing at least 10 civilians. Russian officials said footage of victims amounted to a “hoax launched by the Ukrainian Security Service.”

On Monday, Shyk lay in a hospital bed, surrounded by other civilian men wounded in the city. One had been struck with shrapnel while bringing fresh produce to his wife. Another said a cluster munition landed a few feet from him while he delivered water to civilians.

Gregory Liudnyi, 63, had just biked home from a food handout around 7:30 p.m. on March 4 when he heard explosions in the distance. Rockets struck a telephone pole outside his house, sending a hail of shrapnel flying toward him.

More than a month later, he remains in the hospital — his right leg amputated at the knee despite two surgeries to try to save it. The brutality of the war has left him with “a hard feeling in my soul,” he said. To find work with just one leg, he said, will be nearly impossible.

In the bed next to him lay Valentyn Osypenko. On March 15, he and his wife, Svitlana, heard the roar of a jet pass over their house on the outskirts of town. With the power out, no air raid sirens went off. Still, they fled outside with their son and two neighbors to try to reach a nearby shelter. But they became trapped outside just as three cluster munitions fell in their backyard.

They covered their son, Ruslan, 17, with their own bodies. He escaped without injury, but the parents were both badly wounded.

Ruslan had to apply a tourniquet to his father’s leg as they waited for a ride to the hospital. One of their friends lay dead beside them.

“I think it was intentional that they hit civilian targets,” Valentyn said, showing the wounds to his right leg that remained covered in bloody bandages weeks later. “Our house is destroyed, our car is burned down.”

Svitlana, whose foot was broken, hobbled into Valentyn’s room on crutches and sat beside Ruslan on the next bed.

“We don’t know what we did to deserve this,” she said.

At the morgue behind the hospital, 13 bodies remained unclaimed in a refrigerator truck Monday, wrapped in blankets and plastic sheets. The victims still wore the clothes they were killed in — boots, sweaters, a black winter coat. A passport lay on one’s chest.

Relatives have been unable to collect them, maybe because they fled, or are still too afraid to venture out into the city — or because they too were killed.

Just outside, row after row of empty plywood coffins sat waiting.

With Russian forces occupying one of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants as well the site of the decommissioned Chernobyl facility, the world is getting an unprecedented look at the first major war to ever take place in a country with an established nuclear power infrastructure.

Ukraine runs 15 nuclear reactors accounting for about half of its electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association. But seven of these reactors have been disconnected from the grid since Russian attacks began on February 24 in order to keep them cool.

Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency and Ukrainian nuclear authorities acknowledged that the six reactors of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine had fallen into Russian hands after an intense fire fight that saw a training laboratory on plant premises catch fire.

Now, according to reports from the BBC, Russian troops are training their sights on the three reactors South Ukraine nuclear power plant near the city of Mykolaiv in the country’s southern central region.

The Zaporizhzhya plant – which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station – is now surrounded by the invading troops while Ukrainian technicians continue monitoring plant functions from the inside. Ukrainian regulators have claimed that Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear corporation, has sent engineers to the plant who are now giving orders to the captive staff.

But in a March 12 statement on its website (which may be inaccessible after an attack by the Anonymous hacker group) Rosatom denied that, and characterizing the presence of its engineers at the Ukrainian plant as “consultative assistance” which takes place on “a regular basis.”

Last week, Russian troops detonated ammunition on Zaporizhzhya plant territory that hadn’t exploded during their March 4 attack, though reportedly caused no damage to plant structure. None of the plant’s six reactors, only two of which are currently operational, were affected and there was no radiation leak.

On February 25th, the second day of the invasion, Russian troops overran Chernobyl, which now stores 20,000 spent nuclear fuel rods. The defunct site also houses the remains of the plant’s exploded Number 4 reactor, which is slowly being dismantled under a huge steel dome. The staff that perform those critical activities had been held hostage until last weekend, when about half of them were finally allowed to rotate out after 600 hours on the job since the Russian invasion began.

On two separate occasions, power has been cut to the plant by fighting in the area, leaving critical spent fuel storage pools and radiation ventilation structures without electricity. Power has since been restored, the IAEA reported, but the situation highlights how vulnerable Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are to Russian military aggression.

Now that the coming days could bring the seizure by Russian troops of the South Ukraine plant, we thought it would be useful to revisit our 2018 report on the Ukrainian nuclear industry and highlight the basic characteristics of each of the country’s four Soviet- and Russian-built nuclear power stations.

The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant

Reactor type: Six Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000/320s

Location: The Zaporizhzhya plant is situated on the steppes along the Kakhovka reservoir in the Zaporizhzhya Oblast of Ukraine, near the city of Enerhodar, 690 kilometers southeast of Kyiv. It is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, consisting of six nuclear power units, each with a capacity of 1000 mW. The power produced by the plant provides one fifth of the total power used in Ukraine.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1978 and construction started in 1981. Between 1984 and 1987, Units One, Two, Three and Four were commissioned.

Unit Five was commissioned in 1989 and Unit Six began operations only in 1995, after a post-Chernobyl moratorium on new reactor construction was lifted.

Special spent fuel storage features: The Zaporizhzhya plant is the first in Ukraine to use a dry spent fuel storage facility. Under this scheme, spent fuel elements that have been previously cooled in spent fuel pools for at least five years, during which their residual energy is released, are then transferred to the dry storage facility. There, the assemblies are stored vertically and ventilated by air. The dry spent fuel storage facility at Zaporizhzhya when into service in August of 2001.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two, Four and Five at the Zaporizhzhya plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Two was due to retire in 2016 but will run until 2026. Unit Four was due to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028. Unit Five was due to retire in 2028 but will run until 2030. Unit Three was shut down in 2017 for upgrades associated with a lifetime extensions, though one has not yet been granted.

Notable events: The startup of Unit One was delayed by 11 months because of a fire that occurred at the reactor on January 27, 1984. News about the fire was concealed from the public until Gorbachev’s policy of Glasnost began six years later.

In May of 2014, several armed men representing a far-right political group attempted to gain access to the plant but were stopped by Ukrainian police. The plant’s proximity to the fighting that has ground on in the Donbas region for the last eight years, prior to the outbreak of the current war, has made the plant vulnerable to military attack.

How many reactors currently running: Two, both at reduced power.

The Khmelnitsky Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: RLuts

Reactor type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The Khmelnistky nuclear plant is located in the northern part of the Khmelnitsky region 350 kilometers west of Kyiv in an area of high seismic activity. The plant operates 2 Russian-built VVER-1000 reactors, each produced 1000 mW.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1975 and originally envisioned that it would consist of 4 reactors. Construction on Unit One began in 1981 and finished in 1987, and construction on Unit Two commenced in 1983 but its completion was delayed by a 1990 government-imposed moratorium on new reactor construction. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Unit Two resumed. But lack of financing protracted the project, and it wasn’t completed until 2005.

The plant’s remaining two reactors were originally planned for construction under a 2011 deal with Atomstroyexport, Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom’s foreign wing. That deal was annulled in 2015, following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. A 2016 deal with a Korean power firm to complete the reactors has made little progress.

Also unclear is whether a 2021 deal between the plant and Westinghouse to build an AP 1000 reactor at the site will ever go forward.

Reactor Lifetime Extensions: One reactor at the Khmelnitsky plant has received a lifetime extension. Unit One reactor was scheduled to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028.

Notable Events: In 1987, there was a release of radioactive steam in Unit One’s containment room. The incident was rated by the International Nuclear Event Scale as a 3 its seven-point scale, denoting a “serious” incident with consequences contained within the plant.

How many reactors currently running: One.

The Rivne Nuclear Power Plant

Reactor Type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER 440, two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000

Location: The Rivne Nuclear plant is located near the town of Varash (known as Kuznetsovsk until 2016) in the Rivne Oblast in Ukraine’s northwest, 390 kilometers west of Kyiv. The combined power of the four units it operates is 2835 mW.

Reactor Construction: The plant operates four reactors, two Soviet-built VVER-440s and two Soviet/Russian-built VVER-1000s. It was the first nuclear plant in Ukraine to see the construction of the VVER series reactor, which were a departure from the Soviet designed graphite moderated RBMK-type reactors, one of which exploded at Chernobyl in 1986.

Originally conceived by the Soviets in 1971 as the West Ukraine nuclear plant, the name was changed to Rivne during commissioning. Construction in 1973 and two VVER-440 units were commissioning in 1980 and 1981. Unit Three, which was the first of the two VVER-1000s, was commissioned in 1986.

Unit Four was scheduled to be commissioned in 1991, but the Ukrainian government’s 1990 moratorium on new reactor builds prevented that. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Four resumed in 1993, and it finally entered commercial service in 2006.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two and Three at the Rivne plant have received lifetime extensions: Unit One was due to retire in 2010 but will run until 2030. Unit Two was due to retire in 2011 but will run until 2031. Unit Three was due to retire in 2017 but was granted a 20-year extension to run until 2037.

Notable Events: In December of 2010, Units One and Two of the Rivne plant were granted lifetime extensions of 20 years, nearly doubling their original 30 life expectancy, and putting off their decommissioning until the early 2030s. In 2018, Unit Three received an identical extension, putting off its retirement until 2037.

Another safety issue at the plant is the ground on which it stands, which is characterized by shifting soils and sinkholes, which, if not properly monitored, could endanger plant infrastructure.

How many reactors currently running: Three

The South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant

Reactor Type: Three Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The South Ukraine nuclear plant is located near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv Oblast 350 kilometers south of Kyiv. It is Ukraine’s second largest functioning nuclear plant and is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, along with the Tashlyk Pumped-Storage Power Plant and the Oleksandrivska hydroelectric plant. The plant lies on the steppes on the banks of the Pivdennyi Bug River and its three reactors generate 2850 mW of electicity.

Reactor Construction: Construction of the South Ukraine nuclear plant’s Unit One began in 1975 and was completed in 1983. Units One and Two followed in 1985 and 1989, respectively. A fourth reactor was planned but its construction was suspended by Soviet order.

Reactor lifetime extensions: Two reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions and one was shutdown in 2019 to accommodate upgrades toward an extension.

All three reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2013 but will run until 2023. Unit Two was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Three was due to run until 2020 and is undergoing upgrades that would see it run until 2030.

Notable events: The South Ukraine plant became the first to burn fuel fabricated by western nuclear fuel supplier Westinghouse – part of an effort to wean the Ukrainian industry off its dependents on fuel produced in Russia by TVEL.

In 2005, the plant’s Unit Three was loaded with a mixture of Russian and experimental Westinghouse assemblies for a period of pilot operation. However, the test was unsuccessful with Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, claiming the Westinghouse assemblies had defects. For its part, Westinghouse alleged that its fuel assemblies were loaded incorrectly. This led to a lengthy outage of Unit Three.

Nevertheless, in 2008, Energoatom contracted with Westinghouse for 630 assemblies that would be loaded into the South Ukraine plant’s three reactors.

In 2008 Energoatom and Westinghouse Electric Sweden contracted to ship fresh fuel to as many as six reactors. However, during trial use at South Ukraine NPP in 2012, the fuel became deformed and caused serious damage to the reactor. The use of Westinghouse fuel was then suspended by Ukraine pending its redesign. However, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the contract was revived and extended.

The flight, which will reach Moldova via Romania, will also transport a 40-strong team of medical personnel who will join a group of volunteers the organization sent earlier this week to work at three field hospitals the rescue organization is setting up at Moldova’s Ukraine border for people fleeing Russia’s invasion.

The team is made up of EMTs, paramedics and doctors, as well as members of the organization’s Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit, which provides aid in the field for people who are undergoing trauma. Many of medics expect to be deployed for around two weeks, but the fast-moving crisis means that many could be away from home for longer.

Much of the aid on the plane is medical equipment for the field hospitals, but there is also food, warm clothing, blankets, heat pads, diapers, formula and feminine hygiene products – many of the supplies have been donated by a number of Israeli companies.

In a move that distinguishes the team from other aid organizations, they are also transporting two Torah scrolls for religious members of their teams on the ground.

The plane will return to Israel later in the day carrying some 150 refugees with Israeli citizenship back to Israel.

“The complexity of this operation is immense. It involves travel permits, diplomatic relations, and travel between three countries by land and by air,” says Eli Beer, president of United Hatzalah.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international body’s refugee agency, said Wednesday that over 1 million people are now refugees as a result of the fighting in Ukraine, with concerns that figure will keep climbing. There were 44 million Ukrainians on the eve of the invasion.

Refugees are crossing the borders from Ukraine into neighboring countries to the west — Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of this and other videos that show the moment of the strikes and the aftermath.

One video shows the strike as it happens, with residential buildings torn apart in a split second. Sirens echo as the camera shows parts of the building’s walls torn open, exposing entire apartment rooms. The walls of one apartment complex were reduced to rubble.

A fire is seen on the ground, with smoke elsewhere still rising from the explosion.

The person filming the video moves out into the street, which is littered with debris and damaged cars. The video shows an injured woman on the ground, beside two people who appear burned and unmoving. ""Kids ... little kids,"" she can be heard saying.

CNN does not know the condition of the woman seen in the video.

A second before the military strikes, the roar of a projectile is heard on a surveillance video from a nearby house in Chernihiv, which shows at least five explosions.

Deaths reported: The Ukrainian Emergency Services said on Twitter that as of 6:20 p.m. local time, they had pulled 33 bodies from the rubble of the complex in addition to 18 injured people.

There are no military facilities nearby, only civilian structures like residential buildings and schools, the Chernihiv Regional State Administration told CNN.

Footage captured in the city showed a massive, orange blast lighting up the night sky followed by a loud boom.

Local journalists reported that air raid alerts had been triggered throughout the night with residents urged to seek shelter.

One of the blasts, caught on camera by a CBS crew, cast a bright flash of orange light across the capital.

The presenter, who was forced to duck for cover after a second huge explosion followed within seconds, described it as “a big flash” and “almost like lightning”.

Another clip shared on social media showed what appeared to be an orange fireball erupt on the horizon.

Following heavy overnight shelling of the city, Russia's Defence Ministry said it had disabled a reserve broadcasting centre in the Lysa Hora district, in the south of the city.

It said unspecified precision weapons were used, and claimed there were no casualties or damage to residential buildings.

A statement from the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces didn't address the strikes, saying only that Russian forces were ""regrouping"" and ""trying to reach the northern outskirts"" of the city.

An explosion also rocked Kyiv’s railway station, where thousands of refugees are desperately trying to escape the city.

A Ukrainian interior ministry adviser said that blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. It was not immediately clear whether that was the same blast that caused the orange fireball to erupt.

However, despite another night of heavy bombing, the huge armoured column of Russian tanks and soldiers which is approaching Kyiv appeared to remain stalled outside the capital, having apparently run short on fuel, food and other supplies.

""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30 km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.

10,811f95c7-c52f-43f1-92e4-495c9c3ce086,"['Jim Heintz', 'Associated Press', 'Yuras Karmanau', 'Mstyslav Chernov']",2022-03-03 21:03:36-04:00,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces pressed their attack on a crucial energy-producing city by shelling Europe’s largest nuclear plant early Friday, sparking a fire and raising fears that radiation could leak from the damaged power station.

Plant spokesman Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the Zaporizhzhia plant in the city of Enerhodar and had set fire to one of the facility’s six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.

A government official told The Associated Press that elevated levels of radiation were detected near the plant, which provides about 25 percent of Ukraine’s power generation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not yet been publicly released.

Tuz said firefighters cannot get near the flames because they are being shot at. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted a plea to the Russians to stop the assault and allow fire teams inside.

“We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,” Tuz said in a video statement. “There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.”

The attack renewed fears that the invasion could result in damage to one of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and trigger another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 110 kilometers (65 miles) north of the capital.

The mayor of Enerhodar said earlier that Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars, just a day after the U.N. atomic watchdog agency expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors.

The Ukrainian state atomic energy company reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.

“Many young men in athletic clothes and armed with Kalashnikovs have come into the city. They are breaking down doors and trying to get into the apartments of local residents,” the statement from Energoatom said.

Later, a live streamed security camera linked from the homepage of the Zaporizhzhia plant showed what appeared to be armored vehicles rolling into the facility’s parking lot and shining spotlights on the building where the camera was mounted.

There were then what appeared to be bright muzzle flashes from vehicles, followed by nearly simultaneous explosions in the surrounding buildings. Smoke then rose into the frame and drifted away.

The fighting at Enerhodar came as another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors inside Ukraine to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.

Elsewhere, Russian forces gained ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea, as Ukrainian leaders called on citizens to rise up and wage guerrilla war against the invaders.

While the huge Russian armored column threatening Kyiv appeared bogged down outside the capital, Vladimir Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called on the West to close the skies over the country’s nuclear plants as fighting intensified. “It is a question of the security of the whole world!” he said in a statement.

The U.S. and NATO allies have ruled out creating a no-fly zone since the move would pit Russian and Western military forces against each other.

The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. The battles have knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.

Associated Press video from the port city shows the assault lighting up the darkening sky above largely deserted streets and medical teams treating civilians, including one inside a clinic who appeared to be a child. Doctors were unable to save the person.

Severing Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014.

Overall, the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia’s seizure of Crimea gave it a logistical advantage in that part of the country, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the offensive there.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

“Total resistance. … This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we can do best in the world,” Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.

The second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was held in neighboring Belarus. But the two sides appeared far apart going into the meeting, and Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin’s demand for its “demilitarization” and declare itself neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.

Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron he was determined to press on with his attack “until the end,” according to Macron’s office.

The two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelensky adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

Despite a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of property by the Russian military, Putin decried what he called an “anti-Russian disinformation campaign” and insisted that Moscow uses “only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure.”

Putin claimed that the Russian military had already offered safe corridors for civilians to flee, but he asserted without evidence that Ukrainian “neo-Nazis” were preventing people from leaving and were using them as human shields.

He also hailed Russian soldiers as heroes in a video call with members of Russia’s Security Council, and ordered additional payments to families of men killed or wounded.

A top Russian officer, Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, commander of an airborne division, was killed in the fighting earlier this week, an officers organization in Russia reported.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia’s Ministry of Defense earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.

The fighting has sent more than 1 million people fleeing Ukraine, according to the U.N., which fears those refugee numbers could skyrocket.

Ukrainians still in the country faced another grim day. In Kyiv, snow gave way to a cold, gray drizzle, as long lines formed outside the few pharmacies and bakeries that remained open.

More shelling was reported in the northern city of Chernihiv, where emergency officials said at least 33 civilians had been killed in the bombardment of a residential area.

milies with children fled via muddy and snowy roads in the eastern region of Donetsk, while military strikes on the village of Yakovlivka destroyed 30 homes, leaving three people dead, authorities said.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with about 1.4 million people, residents desperate to escape the bombings crowded the railroad station and squeezed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

In the south, Russian troops appeared to roll from Kherson toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center to the west. A U.S. defense official said the Russians may want to set up a base in Mykolaiv ahead of a ground offensive against Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port city, which is also home to a large naval base.

The immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles still appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in days, amid fuel and food shortages, according to U.S. authorities.
