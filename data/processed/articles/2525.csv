0,482a6953-45c9-4148-9612-09172c3c5597,[],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

Oleh Bulavenko's death was captured in the footage filmed by his son on the outskirts of Kyiv, as they tried to take their pet dogs to safety

The sham of President Putin's claims to not be targeting civilians was laid bare last night as video emerged of a family car being strafed by tank fire on a quiet country road outside Kyiv.

The Russian leader yesterday delivered an address claiming 'gangster' Ukrainian leaders using 'human shields' was the real reason so many civilians had been killed by his troops' onslaught in the country.

But within hours footage emerged showing a father and his adult son having tank rounds unleashed on them as they attempted to rescue their three dogs, having already once fled their home town near Kyiv.

The son who shot the harrowing footage – who hasn't been named by local media – was filming from the passenger seat as their car was forced to pull over by the side of the road after encountering a Russian convoy.

After they stop and as he is asking his father to reverse, and with the army a considerable distance away, bullets tear into the vehicle.

'Get out and lie down,' he shouts at his father, named by media as Oleh Bulavenko. 'Can you hear me? Get back and duck to the right.'

Seconds later more rounds smash into the car. The dogs in the back can be heard wimpering in fear and pain.

The son, whose passenger door is closest to shelter, jumps out into undergrowth but his father must exit into the road. Dozens more shots ring out before the son crawls round the back of the car to find his father lying prone in the road.

'Dad! Dad!' he cries out in anguish. 'Are you still there? Hang in there!'

He tells his father to stay down as the older man tries to sit up to look at his wounds. The footage shows the bullets have torn right through the family saloon leaving large exit holes on the boot despite entering from the front.

'Dad, f***! Why?' the son plaintively asks.

As the shooting subsides, the son crawls from the back of the car again.

'My foot is torn off,' the father growls in agony as he lies in a pool of blood.

The son bravely breaks cover and drags his father into the undergrowth.

The father could be seen lying motionless in the middle of the country lane after the pair were struck with gunshots from a distance

'Please don't die, I'm begging you,' he implores.

But moments later his father died from his injuries, lying in the ditch he was dragged into.

Footage then shows the family pets ripped apart on the backseat of the car. One dog survived the attack, and went to sit with the dead man's body in the gully, refusing to leave.

The heartbreaking footage, which was uncovered and verified by Radio Free Europe, was believed to have been filmed last Friday. The family fled their home in Ivankiv in the Kyiv region after Russian's initial attacks, but returned to get their pets.

Local reporters said they had confirmed no Ukrainian troops were in the area of the attack, which witnesses said came from Russian military vehicles.

The footage graphically exposes the lies of the Kremlin regime who have repeatedly insisted civilians are not being targeted, despite mounting evidence to the contrary.

Putin yesterday hailed his soldiers as heroes who are fighting to save innocent lives and blamed Ukrainian 'neo-Nazis' for holding citizens hostage.

The son, who said his foot had been 'torn off' in the fire, watched on helplessly as he begged for his father to stay alive as he lay in the middle of the road

The son screamed out to 'get out and lie down' as their car became the target of ammunition from what is understood to be a Russian tank

The pair had been driving along a quiet country lane when they are suddenly met with the sound of rapid gunfire and pull to the side of the road

Putin made the claim in his address yesterday, his first since announcing the start of his 'special operation' eight days ago, which did little to reassure anyone that the war is close to being over, or that Russia can be brought to the negotiating table without more blood being shed.

But it also hinted that Putin is rattled as the fighting proves harder than Russian commanders anticipated, and western sanctions go harder and deeper than even European or American observers predicted. All hope of a swift victory has now been dashed, leaving Putin facing a long, bloody and expensive war to achieve his aims.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on his Russian counterpart to sit down with him at the negotiating table in person during another impassioned television appearance shortly after the address.

Zelensky's comments came as Putin's forces continued their brutal assault on several of Ukraine's cities, and on the same day negotiations between the two sides made little progress in deescalating the deadly war.

And the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was on fire in the early hours of Friday morning after an attack by Russian troops.

In an appeal to his Russian counterpart, Zelensky said: 'Get off our land. You don't want to leave now? Then sit down with me at the negotiation table. I'm available. Sit. Just not 30 metres away like with Macron or Scholz etc. I am your neighbour. You don't need to keep me 30 metres away.

'I don't bite. I'm a normal bloke. Sit down with me and talk. What are you afraid of? We aren't threatening anyone, we're not terrorists, we aren't seizing banks and seizing foreign land.'

Zelensky's comments came during a press conference in Kyiv and in response to a reporter's question on what 'guarantees' Ukraine can offer.

'Guarantees for what?' Zelensky fired back at the interviewer in Russian. 'We aren't attacking Russia and we have no intention of doing so. Guarantee what? We aren't in NATO. We don't have nuclear weapons. What am I supposed to say, what am I supposed to give, and to whom?

'You must understand - this is also a huge thing that everybody is talking about - what am I supposed to give? Jesus, what do you want from us?!'

Ukraine's president, who has become an inspirational figure both at home and abroad for his defiance in the face of Russian aggression, also called on the West to supply planes to help his military control the skies. It came after NATO members ruled out enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine for fear of igniting World War Three.

Ukraine war: City by city Kyiv: Four large rocket strikes hit the Ukrainian capital overnight, including one which struck a train station being used to evacuate civilians , while others struck TV and radio stations. Ukraine claimed to have shot down a Russian fighter jet over Irpin, a satellite city of Kyiv which has come under heavy attack, in the early hours of Thursday Kharkiv: The second-largest city in Ukraine continue to come under bombardment with pictures showing destroyed residential buildings and rubble littering the city centre. Izyum, a city 70 miles to the south of Kharkiv towards Donetsk, also came under heavy bombardment with explosions lighting up the night sky Chernihiv: Located to the north-west of Kyiv, the city has been the site of fierce fighting with Russian troops since the early days of the invasion Despite being surrounded and under heavy shelling, the city remains under Ukrainian control Mariupol: Heavy Russian shelling which began targeting the city on Wednesday continued into Thursday, with the mayor saying the bombardment is so heavy that medics can't get into the streets to rescue the dead and injured Despite the attacks, the city remains in Ukrainian hands Kherson: City feared captured by Russian forces after mayor says 'armed visitors' joined a local council meeting and had imposed a curfew However, the British MoD said Thursday morning that the military situation is still 'unclear' - suggesting that Russia may not be in full control Zaporizhzhia: Russian forces have surrounded the city and its nuclear power plant, which is the largest in Europe Civilians set up road blocks around the plant to defend it, with the city's mayor saying one came under fire by Russian troops on Wednesday leaving two people hurt Odessa: The Black Sea port city, and Ukraine's main naval base, is preparing for a Russian assault after a dozen warships were seen forming up near Crimea Mayor said fighter jets appear to be testing air defences by flying sorties overhead, as residents prepare makeshift defences made of old railway sleepers and lay landmines on the beach Advertisement

'If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!' Zelensky told a news conference. 'If we are no more then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next,' he said, adding that direct talks with Putin were 'the only way to stop this war'.

Zelensky - who just weeks ago sought to calm Ukrainians over US allegations that Russia was planning to invade his country - said: 'Nobody thought that in the modern world a man can behave like a beast.'

Soon after Putin's address, Ukraine announced that it has agreed with Russia to create safe corridors - backed by ceasefires - to evacuate civilians and deliver aid to areas under attack by Russian forces. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky also said the agreement had been made during talks, describing it as 'substantial progress'.

The agreement was the only tangible progress from a second round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv, according to an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it was not immediately clear how they would work.

Negotiators from Ukraine and Russia said afterwards that a third round of talks on the war will be held shortly.

So far, more than one million people have fled Ukraine as Putin's armies have laid waste to key cities.

Meanwhile the Russian economy is tanking with the ruble at record lows, the stock market unable to open because it faces near-total collapse, and European countries seizing assets from billionaire oligarchs. Protests have also sprung up in Russia, coupled with high-profile political figures and celebrities calling for the war to end.

Just hours before the TV address, Putin had phoned Emmanuel Macron to tell the French President that he has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or watering down his security demands, will achieve his aims 'whatever happens' and will continue fighting until 'the end'.

Macron's aides said after the call that they believe Putin intends to take the whole country, and that the 'worst is yet to come' as the Russian attacks step up, and that 'there was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us.'

Mr Macron is said to have told Putin he is making a 'major mistake' and 'lying to himself'. Macron said Russia would end up poor, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.

'There was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us. He showed great determination to continue the operation,' Macron's aide said, before adding that Putin 'wanted to seize control of the whole of Ukraine'.

Putin's two statements today - the first he has made in public since announcing the start of his 'special operation' eight days ago - will do little to reassure anyone that the war is close to being over, or that Russia could be brought to the negotiating table without more blood being shed.

News that the convoy has been at least partially damaged or destroyed will come as a huge boon to the people of Kyiv, as it was feared the vehicles would be used to surround and bomb the city into submission. The Ukrainian capital is still under attack by Russian rockets and missiles, but has largely escaped the intense fire being rained down on other locations.

Perhaps the hardest-hit has been the city of Mariupol, on Ukraine's eastern Black Sea coast, which came under bombardment by Russian forces surrounding it yesterday - with the fire kept up near-continuously into today. Local officials say the city is without water, heat, or electricity, and cannot clear the dead from the streets.

Harrowing pictures revealed at least part of the civilian death toll, with a father seen weeping over the body of his son who was killed when a Russian shell destroyed his legs. Two elderly women were also pictured being evacuated from their homes and covered in blood after Russian attacks.

Despite the vicious shelling, the city still remains in the hands of Ukrainian forces - as a defiant Zelensky vowed today that Ukraine will be rebuilt with Russian money as he praised his troops' 'heroic' defence.

Kharkiv, in the east, and Chernihiv, in the north west, also remained under Ukrainian control despite coming under heavy rocket fire. Nine people died in Chernihiv after Russian rockets hit a school and nearby apartments. There were also fears the Russians were about to launch a major amphibious assault against the port city of Odessa after a large fleet of ships was spotted near Crimea in the early hours.

The Ukrainian president said that 'all lines of defence are holding' with the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mykolaiv all resisting Russian attacks. He even claimed the city of Kherson remains in Ukrainian hands, despite the mayor seeming to confirm overnight that it had been taken by Russian forces.

'They wanted to destroy us. They failed. We've been through so much. And if anyone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken or surrender, they know nothing about Ukraine,' Zelensky said, adding: 'We will restore every house, every street, every city and we say to Russia: learn the word 'reparations'.

'You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.'

Separately, one of his presidential advisers said the Ukrainian army is now getting ready to launch counter-attacks on Russian forces after their initial assault on the country stalled - amid reported of fuel and food shortages, heavy casualties, and mismanagement of the operation.

'Help to us is increasing every minute and the strength of the enemy is decreasing every minute. We're not only defending but also counter-attacking,' the adviser said in a televised briefing.

President Zelensky's office said a second round of negotiations had concluded. A first round of talks on Monday ended without an agreement.

Ahead of the invasion, Washington had warned that Russia's superior forces would be able to quickly overwhelm Ukraine's 200,000-strong army - taking out air defences, achieving superiority in the skies, and then raining death down on those below.

But none of that has come to pass. Ukraine's skies remain contested, US intelligence says, while attacks have been piecemeal with troops under-supplied and not fighting in a coordinated fashion, leading to large numbers of dead along with some abandoning their vehicles which have then been captured.

'This is a colossal intelligence failure that vastly underestimated Ukrainian resistance, and military execution has been terrible,' Michael Vickers, former US Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

'[Putin's] main attack has been underweighted. It's been piecemeal. His reconnaissance elements have been captured, columns have been destroyed,' he said. 'It's just a disaster, through and through.'

But many caution that Russia's initial failures could simply pre-sage a secondary phase of the fighting in which it uses superior numbers and force of arms to surround and bomb Ukrainian troops into submission, causing large civilian casualties.

Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, agreed with that assessment today as he issued a warning that the 'worst' is still to come as Russia switches to a 'logic of siege' with major cities in danger of being surrounded.

'The expectation of the president is that the worst is to come, given what President Putin told him,' the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. 'There was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us. He showed great determination to continue the operation,' the aide continued, before adding that Putin 'wanted to seize control of the whole of Ukraine'. 'He will, in his own words, carry out his operation to ''de-Nazify'' Ukraine to the end.' Macron in return told Putin he was making a 'major mistake' by invading a sovereign nation, that he was deluding himself about the government in Kyiv, and that the war would cost Russia dearly over the long term. The French President also urged Putin to avoid civilian casualties and allow for humanitarian access. It comes as the civilian death toll in Ukraine continues to climb as Russian forces carry out a sustained bombing campaign of several major cities including Kharkiv, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and capital Kyiv. After having shared several direct calls with Putin in an attempt to avert war in recent weeks, Macron today told the Russian President directly that he was 'delusional' in light of his invasion of Ukraine. 'You are lying to yourself,' the French President said according to the aide. '[This invasion] will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.' Despite their drastically opposed viewpoints however, there were no signs of aggression between the pair on the call. 'President Putin has a way of talking that is very neutral and very clinical. He sometimes shows signs of impatience, but fundamentally there were no open signs of tensions during the exchanges,' Macron's aide suggested. Advertisement

He spoke as Europe continued to step up its assistance to Ukraine, with Germany pledging another 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to bolster the Ukrainian defences. That comes on top of 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger anti-aircraft weapons it has already sent, in a stunning reversal of its long-standing pledge not to supply weapons.

Kyiv has so-far escaped what observers feared would be Russian attempts to surround and bomb it into submission, after skirmishes in the outskirts led to Moscow's men being pushed back. Sight of the convoy earlier this week seemed to confirm that Putin would resort to 'siege' tactics to force a bloody victory.

But, as of Thursday morning, the convoy was near-motionless - having stalled late Monday. The exact reason is unclear, but American and British intelligence believe it is due to a combination of Ukrainian resistance and logistical problems within the convoy itself.

Reports from the ground indicate that Russian vehicles have been running out of fuel, while pictures also appear to show some vehicles have been poorly maintained and their tyres are falling apart.

A Pantsir missile system bogged down and abandoned in a muddy field lost several of its tyres when Ukrainian forces tried to tow it away, with Trent Teletenko - a former Department of Defence civil servant - wrote on Twitter that it appears Russia has failed to maintain the tyres on its vehicles properly, leaving them brittle.

According to his analysis, it means lowering the pressure in the tyres - which is typically done so they can drive off-road - will cause them to shred, meaning the trucks and artillery systems will be confined to highways or else risk getting bogged down in mud.

Other images showed armoured vehicles bogged down and abandoned after Russian forces tried laying sawed-down trees under their wheels to keep them out of the muck.

Whatever the case, the longer the Russian convoy remains stuck the more vulnerable it becomes to Ukrainian counter attack and the longer the people of Kyiv get to go about their lives without the risk of being shelled.

In just seven days of fighting, more than 2% of Ukraine's population has been forced out of the country, according to the tally the U.N. refugee agency released to The Associated Press.

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, a city of about 1.4 million people and Ukraine's second-largest. Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and another 525 wounded in that time, according to the latest figures from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. It acknowledges that is a vast undercount, and Ukraine earlier said more than 2,000 civilians have died. That figure could not be independently verified.

As the toll of war mounted, a second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was expected later Thursday in neighboring Belarus - though the two sides appeared to have little common ground.

'We are ready to conduct talks, but we will continue the operation because we won't allow Ukraine to preserve a military infrastructure that threatens Russia,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, repeating an accusation Moscow has repeatedly used to justify its invasion.

Lavrov said that the West has continuously armed Ukraine, trained its troops and built up bases there to turn Ukraine into a bulwark against Russia.

The U.S. and its allies have insisted that NATO is a defensive alliance that doesn't pose a threat to Russia. And the West fears Russia's invasion is meant to overthrow Ukraine's government and install a friendly government - though Lavrov said Moscow would let the Ukrainians choose what government they should have.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier raised the specter of nuclear war, putting his country's nuclear forces on high alert, but his foreign minister shrugged off questions of whether Russia could escalate the conflict with nuclear weapons, saying such talk comes from the West.

In Kherson, the Russians took over the regional administration headquarters, Hennady Lahuta, the governor of the region, said Thursday - while adding that he and other officials were continuing to perform their duties and provide assistance to the population.

Kherson's mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, previously said that the national flag was still flying, but that there were no Ukrainian troops in the city. Britain's defense secretary said it was possible the Russians had taken over, though not yet verified.

The mayor said the city would maintain a strict curfew and require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to 'provoke the troops.'

'The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,' he wrote on Facebook. 'And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.'

Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian land forces have stalled and Moscow is now unleashing air attacks, but that they are being parried by Ukrainian defense systems, including in Kherson.

'Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack. Our air defenses worked,' he said. 'Kherson, Izyum - all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.'

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions heard overnight in the Ukrainian capital were Russian missiles being shot down by air defense systems.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center to the west along the coast. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops are advancing on the city but said that they will likely need to regroup before trying to take it over.

A group of Russian amphibious landing vessels is also heading toward the port of Odesa, farther west, the Ukrainian military said.

Moscow's isolation deepened when most of the world lined up against it at the United Nations to demand it withdraw from Ukraine. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes. And in a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Winter Paralympic Games.

Russia reported its military casualties Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses.

Ukraine's military general staff said in a Facebook post that Russia's forces had suffered some 9,000 casualties in the fighting. It did not clarify if that figure included both killed and wounded soldiers.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskyy praised his country's resistance.

'We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,' he said. 'They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.'

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who 'go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.'

'These are not warriors of a superpower,' he said. 'These are confused children who have been used.'

Meanwhile, the senior U.S. defense official said an immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteers well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance.

'In my old age, I had to take up arms,' said Andrey Goncharuk, 68. He said the fighters needed more weapons, but 'we'll kill the enemy and take their weapons.'

Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees.

Among the million-plus refugees who have fled Ukraine in recent days were some 200 orphans with severe physical and mental disabilities who arrived from Kyiv by train in Hungary on Wednesday.

Some of them spent more than an hour in underground shelters during a bombing, said Larissa Leonidovna, the director of the Svyatoshinksy orphanage for boys.

Overnight, Associated Press reporters in Kyiv heard at least one explosion before videos started circulating of apparent strikes on the capital.

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had knocked out a reserve broadcasting center in the Lysa Hora district, about 7 kilometers (4 miles) south of the government headquarters. It said unspecified precision weapons were used, and that there were no casualties or damage to residential buildings.

A statement from the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces didn't address the strikes, saying only that Russian forces were 'regrouping' and 'trying to reach the northern outskirts' of the city.

'The advance on Kyiv has been rather not very organized and now they're more or less stuck,' military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told the AP in Moscow.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and another 525 wounded since the invasion began, according to the latest figures from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Earlier, Ukraine said more than 2,000 civilians have died, a figure that could not be independently verified.

The U.N. office uses strict methodology and counts only confirmed casualties, and admits its figures are a vast undercount.

Still, the tally eclipses the entire civilian casualty count from the fighting in 2014 in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces - which left 136 dead and 577 injured.

In a videotaped address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance. He vowed that the invaders would have 'not one quiet moment' and described Russian soldiers as 'confused children who have been used.'

Moscow's isolation deepened when most of the world lined up against it at the United Nations to demand it withdraw from Ukraine. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes. And in a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Winter Paralympic Games.

Felgenhauer said with the Russian economy already suffering, there could be a 'serious internal political crisis' if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not find a way to end the war quickly.

'There's no real money to run to fight this war,' he said, adding that if Putin and the military 'are unable to wrap up this campaign very swiftly and victoriously, they're in a pickle.'

Several parts of the country were under pressure.

Ukraine's military said Russian forces 'did not achieve the main goal of capturing Mariupol' in its statement, which did not mention the another important port, Kherson, whose status was unclear.

Putin's forces claimed to have taken complete control of Kherson, and U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Thursday that it was 'possible - it's not verified yet - that Russia is in control' there.

A senior U.S. defense official earlier disputed the Russians controlled the city.

'Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city,' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Zelenskyy's office told the AP that it could not comment on the situation in Kherson while the fighting was still going on.

The mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhaev, said Russian soldiers were in the city and came to the city administration building. He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets.

'We don't have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE,' he said in a statement later posted on Facebook.

The mayor said Kherson would maintain a strict 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and restrict traffic into the city to food and medicine deliveries. The city will also require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to 'provoke the troops.'

'The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,' he wrote. 'And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.'

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the attacks there had been relentless.

'We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop,' he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.

Russia reported its military casualties for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses.

Vladimir Putin's forces have made further gains in Ukraine, seizing control of a nuclear power plant and reducing cities to rubble as Volodymyr Zelensky desperately battles to save his country from the invading forces on the ninth day of fighting.

Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday, with CCTV capturing a fierce gun battle that sparked a fire in a six-storey training building just outside the main complex.

Warships are still poised off the coast of Odessa, while the port city of Mykolaiv, near Kherson which was the first city claimed by Russia, is feared to be the next under Putin's control.

Kyiv continues to face intense shelling but has so far been spared a major assault, with Russia's main attack force stalled for days in a miles-long convoy on a highway to the north.

But there are growing concerns that the stationary troops are regrouping and amassing logistical supplies before launching a fierce onslaught on the capital.

Putin want to 'sever' Ukraine in half and deprive the north of resources needed to keep fighting the war - a siege tactic reminiscent of how he won the Chechen war in 2000.

Just over a week after Putin launched his savage campaign, MailOnline assesses the gains being made by the Russians in the cities where they are meeting fierce resilience from Ukraine.

Kyiv

Moscow's advance on Ukraine's capital may have stalled but the city is still being subjected to heavy bombardment from the air.

Loud explosions could be heard this morning and an air raid siren constantly blared.

Blasts also rocked the city yesterday and Hostomel Airport has seen intense fighting, with the transport hub changing hands multiple times in recent days.

Russian tanks and armoured vehicles are yet to enter the city, with the huge convoy still stuck around 16 miles from Kyiv.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with comical mishaps including fuel and food shortages.

But there are also some concerns that the 15,000 troops attached to the convoy may be regrouping and waiting for supplies before launching a blistering assault on Kyiv.

Russia made clear its plans to quickly seize the capital, with Western security officials fearing they would overthrow the government and implement their new regime within days.

But stiffer than expected resistance from the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians has staved off the swift victory that Russia may have expected.

An aide to Zelensky has called on soldier and volunteers to use guerrilla tactics against Russian forces, to cut down trees and destroy rear columns of Russian troops.

Zaporizhzhia

Putin's troops attacked the continent's largest nuclear power plant overnight, sparking a fire that raged for hours before emergency crews were eventually allowed to extinguish it as Russian soldiers seized the complex.

Russian troops had attacked the Zaporizhzhia plant in the early hours of Friday, with CCTV capturing a fierce gun battle between Putin's men and Ukrainian defenders that sparked a fire in a six-storey training building just outside the main complex.

Moscow's men then stopped firefighters getting to the building for several hours.

Eventually, emergency crews were allowed to go in and douse the flames before Russian troops moved in an occupied the site, which provides a fifth of Ukraine's electricity.

Fire-damaged buildings at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear complex are pictured on Friday morning after coming under attack by Russian forces overnight, leading to international condemnation

The UN's nuclear monitoring agency said that, fortunately, none of the site's six reactors had been directly damaged and radiation levels remained normal. Three Ukrainian troops were killed defending the complex, Kyiv said.

Moscow has, predictably, attempted to deny responsibility for the attack, saying its forces had come under attack by Ukrainian 'saboteurs' while patrolling the plant, who then set fire to the building themselves.

Ukraine is home to three other active nuclear power plants, one of which is located 70 miles from the city of Mykolaiv which Russian forces have begun attacking after seizing nearby Kherson. The other two active sites are located in the west and are not currently under threat, though that situation could change as the Russian attack branches out. Ukraine also has five sites which are out of action, including Chernobyl, but could still pose a risk if hit by shells.

President Zelensky said the attack on Zaporizhzhia could have caused a crisis equivalent to 'six Chernobyls' - referencing the fact that the modern-day plant has six reactors while the Soviet-era disaster affected only one - and called on Russians to end the fighting.

Russian armoured vehicles and troops attacked the nuclear power plant in the early hours of Friday, shooting and shelling guards holed up in administrative buildings near the nuclear reactors - setting one of them on fire

Zaporizhzhia has six nuclear reactors, making it the largest of its kind in Europe, and accounts for about one quarter of Ukraine's power generation. One report said the fire was about 150 meters away from one of the reactors

Nuclear experts told the BBC that attacks on Zaporizhzhia were 'frightening' but that any disaster caused by fighting would be similar to Fukushima in 2011 rather than Chernobyl in 1986. Fukushima, in Japan, melted down after a tsunami cut electricity to the plant, disabling its cooling system. Chernobyl exploded after a training exercise gone-wrong caused an uncontrolled nuclear reaction.

Claire Corkhill, professor of nuclear materials at Sheffield University, told the corporation that the reactors at Zaporizhzhia now appear to be shutting down to remove the danger - which may have been Russia's intention in attacking the plant.

Mykolaiv

Fears are growing that Mykolaiv will soon be the biggest city to fall to Russia.

The mayor said Russian troops had entered his city of around 500,000 people and there was now fighting inside it.

Local authorities in the shipbuilding city told residents not to panic and Zelenskiy's military adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the Russian advance there had been halted.

'We can feel cautious optimism about the future prospects of the enemy offensive - I think that it will be stopped in other areas also,' he said

The US believes Russia's goal may be to move past Kherson to Mykolaiv in order to set up a base of operations there that they can then use in a move to encircle and take Odesa.

In a video statement shared online, Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said fighting was under way in parts of the city. 'Let's not get nervous,' he said.

Kherson

Kherson remains the only city to be captured by Russian forces in a huge strategic win for Putin.

The city allows his troops to cross the Dnieper River and advance on Kyiv from the south, with army commanders able to link up the two main offensives.

The city also holds the fresh water supply for the region, meaning Russia could use it in Crimea.

Mayor Igor Kolykhaevr said 'armed visitors' joined a local council meeting and imposed a curfew. He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets.

The mayor said Russian troops had entered his city of around 500,000 people and there was now fighting inside it.

The city will also require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to 'provoke the troops.'

Cutting Ukraine's access to the coastline would deal a crippling blow to the country's economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor stretching from its border, across Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and all the way west to Romania.

Mariupol

Perhaps the hardest-hit has been the city of Mariupol, on Ukraine's eastern Black Sea coast, with the fire kept up near-continuously into today with the city completely surrounded.

The heavy Russian shelling of Mariupol has been compared to the Nazi Siege of Leningrad in World War Two which lasted for three years and practically levelled the entire city.

An incessant attack of artillery, rockets and airstrikes has obliterated the city and killed hundreds.

Capturing the city would allow Russia to link Donetsk and Luhansk with Crimea which was annexed in 2014.

Local officials say the city is without water, heat, or electricity, and bombardment is so heavy that medics cannot clear the dead from the streets.

Mariupol is all-but surrounded by Russian forces attempting to smash the city into submission as Putin's men resort to bloody siege tactics.

'They are trying to create a blockade here, just like in Leningrad,' Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said, referring to the brutal Nazi siege of Russia's second city, now re-named Saint Petersburg.

Kharkiv

In the northeast, along another major axis of the Russian attack, the city of Kharkiv has been under bombardment since the start of the invasion which worsened sharply this week, but defenders are holding out.

Dozens have been killed and hundreds injured in the city which has been reduced to rubble with many residential buildings destroyed.

The city remains under Ukrainian control but Russian paratroopers landed on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday and raided a military hospital.

If Russia seizes the city, it will be able to launch an offensive on Kyiv from another front.

Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the railroad station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

Despite the intense attacks on the city, Ukraine forces are still putting up a stiff resistance and captured a unit of Russian troops over the weekend.

Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs have crowded the railroad station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

The city hall has been shelled and many parts of the city have no water, electricity or heating.

On Tuesday, the opera house, concert hall and government offices were hit in a series of strikes, which killed at least 10 people, despite Russia's claim it is only targeting military sites.

Meanwhile the central Freedom Square was attacked on Wednesday, which Zelensky labelled 'frank, undisguised terror. Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime.'

It wasn't immediately clear what type of weapon was used or how many people were killed, but Zelensky said there were dozens of casualties.

It was the first time the Russian military had hit the center of the city of 1.5 million people whose residential neighborhoods have been under shelling fire for days.

Izyum, a city 70 miles to the south of Kharkiv towards Donetsk, has also came under heavy bombardment with explosions lighting up the night sky.

Despite the incessant shelling and bombardment, Kharkiv remains in Ukrainian hands.

Chernihiv

Chernihiv, to the north east of Kyiv, and Kharkiv, in Ukraine's east, were braced for more heavy shelling today after days of increasingly indiscriminate attacks including with banned cluster munitions have left dozens of civilians dead.

Located to the north-west of Kyiv, the city has been the site of fierce fighting with Russian troops since the early days of the invasion but is still under Ukraine's control.

Yesterday, at least 47 people were killed after Russian forces hit residential areas, including schools and a high-rise apartment block, with the banned cluster bombs according to local officials.

Rescue work had to be suspended due to the heavy shelling.

Odessa

The Black Sea port city, and Ukraine's main naval base, is preparing for a Russian assault after a dozen warships were seen forming up near Crimea.

Defences are being built with fears that Putin wants to choke the economy by seizing the port through which grain and minerals are exported to Europe.

The mayor said fighter jets appear to be testing air defences by flying sorties overhead, as residents prepare makeshift defences made of old railway sleepers and lay landmines on the beach.

There have also been reports of Russian rocket or artillery fire at the city's airport, Ukraine's deputy defence minister said.

But an official said despite bracing for an attack, there has been no major Russian military moves on the port city.

Footage circulating on social media appears to show a group of Russian naval warships off the coast of Odessa in south Ukraine, ahead of a likely invasion from which could cut off Ukraine's vital access to the Black Sea

Meanwhile, an Estonian-owned cargo ship was sunk off the coast of Ukraine after hitting a mine yesterday.

Four crew members are still missing and two are in a life raft at sea following the explosion near Odessa.

Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, said the ship likely struck a mine, adding: 'The vessel has finally sunk. Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don't know where they are at the moment.'

Estonia is a member of NATO and the EU, and while an official reason has yet to be given for the blast, the possibility that it was the result of a mine risks further destabilising an already explosive situation in Eastern Europe.

The 37-year-old Helt was flying under the Panamanian flag, like many merchant ships who wish to avoid their own countries' strict marine regulations.

It comes after the Russian Black Sea Fleet was accused of using civilian vessels including the Helt as human shields in the invasion of Ukraine.

The military said the Russian Navy forced the Helt to enter a dangerous zone of the Black Sea to cover the movement of its own warships.

Russian forces captured a strategic Ukrainian port and besieged another in a bid to cut the country off from the sea, as the two sides met for another round of talks aimed at stopping the fighting that has set off an exodus of over one million refugees.

Moscow's advance on Ukraine's capital has apparently stalled over the past few days, with a huge armoured column north of Kyiv at a standstill, but the military has made significant gains in the south as part of an effort to sever the country's connection to the Black and Azov seas.

The Russian military said it had control of Kherson, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed that forces have taken over local government headquarters in the Black Sea port of 280,000, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea, plunging it into darkness, isolation and fear. Electricity and phone service were largely down, and homes and shops faced food and water shortages.

Without phone connections, medics did not know where to take the wounded. A second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations began in neighbouring Belarus, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office.

But the two sides appeared to have little common ground going into the meeting, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin's demand for its ""demilitarisation"" and declare itself neutral, formally renouncing its bid to join Nato.

Mr Putin has long contended that Ukraine's turn toward the West is a threat to Moscow, an argument he used to justify the invasion.

Despite a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure by the Russian military, some of it documented by The Associated Press, Mr Putin also called accusations that his military had attacked residential areas part of ""an anti-Russian disinformation campaign"" and insisted that Russia uses ""only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure"".

Ukrainians still in the country faced another grim day. In Kyiv, snow gave way to a cold, grey drizzle, as long lines formed outside the few pharmacies and bakeries that remain open. New shelling was reported in the northern city of Chernihiv, where the mayor said he was struggling to organise safe passage for civilians.

Families with children fled via muddy and snowy roads in the eastern region of Donetsk, while military strikes on the village of Yakovlivka near the eastern city of Kharkiv destroyed 30 homes, leaving three dead and seven injured, and rescuers pulled 10 people from the ruins, according to emergency authorities.

Ukrainian authorities called on the people to wage guerrilla warfare against Mr Putin's forces by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear.

""Total resistance... This is our Ukrainian trump card and this is what we can do best in the world,"" Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovich said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during the Second World War.

In just seven days of fighting, more than two per cent of Ukraine's population has been forced out of the country, according to the tally the UN refugee agency released to The Associated Press. The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, Russia's second-largest city, with about 1.4 million people. Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the railroad station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and 525 wounded in that time, according to the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, though it acknowledged that is a vast undercount, and Ukraine earlier said more than 2,000 civilians have died. That figure could not be independently verified.

Meanwhile, a senior US defence official said the immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 16 miles from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last few days. The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

Mr Zelensky said that Russian land forces have stalled and Moscow is now unleashing air attacks, but that they are being parried by Ukrainian defence systems, including in Kherson.

""Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack. Our air defences worked,"" he said. ""Kherson, Izyum - all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.""

Kyiv mayor and former boxer Vitali Klitschko said explosions heard overnight in the Ukrainian capital were Russian missiles being shot down by air defence systems. In Kherson, the Russians took over the regional administration headquarters, said Hennady Lahuta, governor of the region. But he added that he and other officials continued to perform their duties.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding centre to the west. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops were advancing on the city.

A group of Russian amphibious landing vessels also headed toward the port of Odesa, farther west, the Ukrainian military said. Russia reported its military casualties on Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine insisted Russia's losses are many times higher but did not disclose its own military casualties.

In a video address to the nation early on Thursday, Mr Zelensky praised his country's resistance.

""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,"" he said. ""They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.""

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who ""go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat"".

""These are not warriors of a superpower,"" he said. ""These are confused children who have been used.""

Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees. Among the million-plus refugees who have fled Ukraine in recent days were some 200 orphans with severe physical and mental disabilities who arrived from Kyiv by train in Hungary on Wednesday.

Ukraine’s state emergencies agency said the strike was on a residential area in the city of 280,000 people in Ukraine’s north.

It said the casualties could be higher as rescuers continue to look through debris.

It comes as Ukraine President Zelenskyy’s office says the second round of talks with the Russians has begun over the war in his country.

A video released by Zelenskyy’s office Thursday showed the informally dressed Ukrainian delegation walking into the meeting room where they shook hands with Russian delegates in suits and ties.

The talks are aimed at stopping the fighting that has sent more than 1 million people fleeing over Ukraine’s borders, but the two sides appeared to have little common ground.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin’s demand for its “demilitarization” and declare itself neutral, formally renouncing its bid to join NATO. Putin has long contended that Ukraine’s turn toward the West is a threat to Moscow, an argument he used to justify last week’s invasion.

Mr Zelenskyy has called for Russian leader Vladimir Putin to meet him, salting the proposal with sarcasm.

“Sit down with me to negotiate, just not at 30 metres,” he said, apparently referring to recent photos of Mr Putin sitting at one end of an extremely long table when he met French President Emmanuel Macron.

“I don’t bite. What are you afraid of?” Mr Zelenskyy said at a news conference.

He said it would be sensible to have talks, adding: “Any words are more important than shots.”

He said the world was too slow to offer support for Ukraine and prodded Western leaders to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to deny access to the Russian warplanes. The US and NATO allies have ruled out the move that would directly pit Russian and Western militaries.

Zelenskyy charged that if the West remains reluctant to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, it should at least provide Kyiv with warplanes.

Russia has declined to attend as an observer a Nato drill in Norway with about 30,00 troops from 27 nations later this month.

Mr Zelenskyy earlier said that defensive lines are so far holding as Russian forces escalated attacks across urban areas throughout his country.

“We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” Zelenskyy said in a video address posted to his Facebook page this morning.

Mr Zelenskyy said Russia’s changing tactics and shelling of civilians in cities proved Ukraine was successfully resisting Moscow's push for a quick victory in the conflict.

As he spoke, Russian troops moved around the centre of the Ukrainian port of Kherson after a day of conflicting claims over whether they had captured a major urban centre for the first time since the invasion began eight days ago.

Russia's defence ministry said it controlled Kherson on Wednesday but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Ukrainian forces continued to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people.

Pro-Russian forces are also understood to be preparing to launch targeted strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol unless Ukrainian forces there surrender. Russia and separatists say they have surrounded the city of 430,000 located on the Azov Sea.

French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken for 90 minutes by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who told Mr Macron the war in Ukraine is “going according to plan”, a French official said.

The official at the French Elysee presidential palace said Mr Putin told Mr Macron the invasion will continue “until the end” unless negotiations meet his terms.

Mr Putin said negotiations must centre on the “neutralisation and disarmament of Ukraine,” according to the French official. Mr Putin reportedly said he would attain that goal by military means, if not by political and diplomatic means.

Meanwhile, an enormous 65km Russian military convoy is continuing to move toward Ukraine's capital, though British intelligence has suggested the convoy's progress had slowed significantly.

Second round of talks to begin as death toll mounts

A Ukrainian delegation had left for a second round of talks with Russian officials on a ceasefire, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.

Russian forces have yet to overthrow the government in Kyiv but thousands are reported to have died or been injured and more than a million people have fled Ukraine amid the biggest attack on a European state since 1945.

The tally from UNHCR amounts to more than 2% (over 1m people) of Ukraine’s population on the move in under a week. The World Bank counted Ukraine's population at 44 million at the end of 2020.

At Borodyanka, a town 58km northwest of Kyiv, a resident gave a breathless account of their encounter with the enemy, as Reuters Television footage showed shell damaged buildings, fires burning in the streets and destroyed military vehicles.

""They (Russian military) started shooting from their BMP (military vehicle), towards the park in front of the post office in the centre of Borodyanka,"" said a Ukrainian man, who did not give his name.

""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the Fora (supermarket) which was already burned. It caught fire again.""

Sanctions

The capture of Kherson, a strategic southern provincial capital where the Dnipro River flows into the Black Sea, would be the first significant urban centre to fall since Moscow launched its invasion on February 24.

Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said late on Wednesday that Russian troops were in the streets and had entered the council building.

He called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos.

""There were armed visitors in the city executive committee today,"" he said in a statement.

I didn't make any promises to them ... I just asked them not to shoot people.

Russia's attack has led to a barrage of international sanctions that threaten the global economic recovery from the Covid pandemic, and stoked fears of wider conflict as Western countries send arms to help the Ukrainian military.

The US State Department called on Putin and the Russian government to ""immediately cease this bloodshed"" and withdraw forces from Ukraine.

'A full war on media freedom and the truth'

It also accused Moscow of launching a ""full war on media freedom and the truth"" by blocking independent news outlets and social media to prevent Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

It denies targeting civilians although there have been widespread reports of civilian casualties and the shelling of residential areas.

Bombing in Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, has left its centre a wasteland of ruined buildings and debris.

Russians have shelled the city of Izyum, about 120km southeast of Kharkiv, killing six adults and two children, Ukraine's parliament said. The exact number of casualties has yet to be verified.

The UN Human Rights Office has confirmed the deaths of 227 civilians and 525 injuries during the conflict as of midnight on March 1, cautioning that the real toll would be much higher due to reporting delays.

An explosion also rocked the Kyiv railway station where thousands of women and children were being evacuated.

The blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser said, and there were no immediate reports of casualties.

A UN resolution reprimanding Moscow was supported by 141 of the assembly's 193 members, a symbolic victory for Ukraine that increases Moscow's international isolation.

""More is at stake even than the conflict in Ukraine itself. This is a threat to the security of Europe and the entire rules-based order,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow still sought Ukraine's ""demilitarisation"" and that there should be a list of specified weapons that could never be deployed on Ukrainian territory.

Moscow opposes Kyiv's bid to join NATO.

Oil and commodity prices spiralled ever higher on Thursday in a grim omen for global inflation.

For Russians, the fallout has included queues outside banks, a plunge in the value of the rouble which threatens their living standards, and an exodus of Western firms who refuse to do business in the country.

Japanese automakers including Toyota were forced to halt production in Russia as sanctions scrambled logistics and cut off supply chains.

Russia's central bank, itself under sanctions, has doubled interest rates to 20% and Fitch and Moody's rating agencies downgraded Russia's sovereign credit rating to 'junk' status.
