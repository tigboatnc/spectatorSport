In the Black Sea, the enemy fleet continues to block the coast Odessa region.

About it informed Sergey Bratchuk, press secretary of the operational headquarters of the Odessa Regional Military Administration.

“In the Black Sea, the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation blocks our coast, and also periodically regroups its forces and means,” Bratchuk said.

There is also a high probability of enemy missile strikes on Odessa and the region.

According to Bratchuk, now the situation in the city and the region is under control. The military has enough forces and means to engage the enemy with fire.

5,22cad4b6-d8d2-4aa6-8884-f05f1cac3d8a,[],,"KRAMATORSK, Ukraine, April 9, 2022 (BSS/AFP) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a ""firm global response"" Friday after a missile strike killed 52 people at a train station in eastern Ukraine where civilians had gathered to flee a feared Russian offensive.

""This is another Russian war crime for which everyone involved will be held accountable,"" Zelensky said in a video message, referring to Friday's missile strike, whose victims included five children.

""World powers have already condemned Russia's attack on Kramatorsk. We expect a firm global response to this war crime,"" he continued.

World leaders condemned the attack in the Donetsk capital, with US President Joe Biden accusing Russia of being behind a ""horrific atrocity"" that the French condemned as a ""crime against humanity.""

At least 52 people including five children were killed, the regional government said, while Zelensky reported 300 wounded, saying the strike showed ""evil with no limits"".

Zelensky said the bombing had been reported in Russia before the missiles had even landed and called for more weaponry to counter Moscow's aggression.

""I am sure that the victory of Ukraine is just a matter of time, and I will do everything to reduce this time,"" he added.

AFP journalists saw the bodies of at least 30 people under plastic sheets next to the station.

Body parts, packed bags and stuffed animals were flung across the floor.

On the station forecourt, the remains of a missile were still visible.

It was tagged with white paint with the words ""for our children"" in Russian, an expression frequently used by pro-Russian separatists in reference to their losses since the start of the first Donbas war in 2014.

""I was in the station. I heard, like, a double explosion. I rushed to the wall for protection,"" said Natalia, searching for her passport among the abandoned belongings.

Another woman in a state of shock told AFP: ""I saw people covered in blood entering the station and bodies everywhere on the ground.""

Russia denied being behind the missile strike, which came with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in Kyiv for talks with Zelensky and to visit the scene of civilian killings in the town of Bucha.

Russia faces ""decay"" because of ever tougher sanctions and Ukraine had a ""European future"", Von der Leyen said at a news conference with Zelensky.

Six weeks into President Vladimir Putin's invasion, Moscow has shifted its focus to eastern and southern Ukraine after stiff resistance ended plans to swiftly capture the capital Kyiv.

- 'All this horror' -

Russian troops appear set on creating a long-sought land link between occupied Crimea and the Moscow-backed separatist statelets of Donetsk and Lugansk in the Donbas region, where civilians have been urged to flee heavy shelling that has laid waste to towns and complicated evacuation efforts.

""There is no secret -- the battle for Donbas will be decisive. What we have already experienced -- all this horror -- it can multiply,"" warned Lugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday.

In the city of Lozova west of Kramatorsk, more than 15,000 people have fled, Oleg Sinegubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, said on Telegram.

""There are still about 50 thousand [people]. A large number of people will leave. Departures are organized both by rail and own vehicles,"" he said, adding that fighting was taking place nearby.

In the south, the Black Sea port city of Odessa girded for rocket attacks, imposing a weekend curfew.

Residents and Ukrainian officials returning after a Russian withdrawal from an area near Kyiv, meanwhile, were taking stock of the scale of the devastation.

Bucha, where authorities say hundreds were killed -- some with their hands bound -- has become a byword for the brutality allegedly inflicted under Russian occupation.

But Zelensky warned worse was being uncovered.

""They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodianka,"" northwest of Kyiv, he said in his nightly address. ""It is much more horrific there. There are even more victims of Russian occupiers.""

Conflict in the area has wrought massive destruction and bodies are only now being retrieved, with 27 recovered from two destroyed buildings, according to Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova.

Fresh allegations also emerged from Obukhovychi, northwest of Kyiv, where villagers told AFP they were used as human shields.

- 'Help us now' -

Moscow has denied targeting civilians, but growing evidence of atrocities has galvanised Ukraine's allies in the EU, which has approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closure of its ports to Russian vessels.

The bloc has frozen 30 billion euros ($32.6 billion) in assets from blacklisted Russian and Belarusian individuals and companies, it said Friday.

It also blacklisted Putin's two adult daughters and more than 200 others as part of its latest sanctions package, according to an official list published late Friday.

The United States and Britain had already sanctioned the Russian leader's daughters.

En route to Kyiv, Borrell told journalists the EU would supply 7.5 million euros to train Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate war crimes, which Russia is accused of committing.

At the United Nations General Assembly, 93 nations voted Thursday to suspend Russia from the body's human rights council, prompting accusations from Moscow that the move was ""illegal and politically motivated.""

""Russia's lies are no match for the undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine,"" Biden said, calling the invasion ""an outrage to our common humanity"".

Ukraine has welcomed new pressure on Moscow, but it continues to push for harsher sanctions and more heavy weaponry.

""Either you help us now -- and I'm speaking about days, not weeks -- or your help will come too late and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed,"" foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said after meeting NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.

Britain said Friday it was sending Ukraine more ""high-grade military equipment"" including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles, while Slovakia said it had given Ukraine an S-300 air defence system.",https://www.bssnews.net/news-flash/55063

As the eastern Europe team leader for an investment firm, Richards already spoke Russian. Now, with his family’s relocation on hold, Richards is “diving deep” into studying Ukrainian and taking an intensive online course from Lviv’s Ukrainian Catholic University.

“I want to speak with Ukrainians in Ukrainian to celebrate their culture, their liberty and the incredible courage with which they are now standing up in their own defense in the face of indescribable and unprovoked brutality,” he said.

Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, rooted in the idea that a uniquely Ukrainian identity does not exist, has only increased global interest in the Ukrainian language. Suppressed and denounced as a peasant dialect by the Russian and Soviet empires, Ukrainian is a distinct language from Russian, with a degree of similarity somewhat akin to that between Italian and Portuguese.

The language learning app Duolingo reported a 577% increase in the number of global users studying Ukrainian and a 2,677% increase in Poland, which has welcomed more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees. In Ukraine, where native Russian speakers have increasingly embraced Ukrainian since the 2014 revolution, a new Ukrainian conversation club received close to 1,000 sign-ups in just three days.

Like most Ukrainians, Sophia Reshetniak, 20, is fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian. She grew up using Russian with her family, but learned Ukrainian at school. (About 46% of the population speak Ukrainian at home, 28% speak Russian and a quarter speak both equally, according to a 2019 survey.)

“It’s my second mother language,” she said. “I have friends from the west [of Ukraine] and they are talking in Ukrainian and we understand each other.”

Before Russia invaded her home city of Kharkiv, Reshetniak was a university student and taught private lessons in English, Ukrainian and Russian. She lost her regular students after she fled the country, but has since found new ones through a social enterprise called NaTakallam, which hires displaced people to teach their languages and share their cultures online.

NaTakallam, which means “we speak’’ in Arabic, launched in 2015 with a goal of generating income for Syrians in Lebanon who lost their livelihoods fleeing war. “You can give aid, but giving a job or giving income that’s earned is just so much more respectful and rewarding and makes people feel much more empowered,” said co-founder Aline Sara. “They get a restored sense of dignity and purpose, and they share their story, which is one thing we really need the world to hear” to combat discrimination against refugees, particularly those from the Middle East and Africa. The company pays tutors a minimum of $10 an hour.

The platform has since expanded to offer lessons in Armenian, English, French, Kurdish, Persian and Spanish and hired its first Ukrainian and Russian teachers in March. Sara said about 150 to 200 people have expressed interest in studying these two languages, with “slightly more traction” in Russian as it is more widely spoken, though many want to learn both.

Reshetniak now teaches from the hostel room she shares with her 15-year-old sister in a Czech village. She was matched with her first students within days of being onboarded by NaTakallam. Two are learning Ukrainian and three are learning Russian.



While Reshetniak doesn’t see Russian as the “language of enemies”, some who once used it to get by in Ukraine are choosing to learn Ukrainian as a sign of respect.

Polina Levina, a Canadian with Russian parents and a grandmother from Kharkiv who spent two years in Donetsk and Kyiv working on human rights with the United Nations, said that she “always felt that speaking fluent Russian was enough to engage with the country”. Now, she believes, it’s important “to be able to listen to Ukrainians in whichever language they prefer to speak, to allow them the freedom of not having to revert to the lingua franca if they choose not to”.

Some learners see studying Ukrainian as a way to help the country rebuild. Abby Davis, an IT project management consultant based in Atlanta, lived in Druzhkivka, a town in Ukraine’s largely Russian-speaking eastern Donbas region, as a “bilingual tot” in the 90s with her missionary family. She hopes to apply her skills to strengthen the country’s IT infrastructure and has been using the Pimsleur app to learn some conversational Ukrainian “to be ready to help”.

Several learning platforms have extended special offers related to Ukraine. LingQ is offering free access to Ukrainian lessons and free premium accounts for Ukrainians studying other languages. MyCoolClass, a teacher-owned cooperative, has waived fees and simplified the application process for Ukrainian teachers using its platform. Duolingo has pledged to donate all ad revenue generated by learners of Ukrainian to relief efforts “for at least the next year”.

Richards still plans to settle in Kyiv when it’s safe to do so, and hopes to be able to converse in Ukrainian when he does.

“It feels like the war has changed everything,” he said. “Ukrainian has become a symbol of heritage, survival, strength and resistance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/08/ukrainian-langauge-interest-spikes-support-country-war

By Mark Stone, Sky Correspondent

We've spent the day in two eastern Ukrainian towns in the Donbas region where the next ferocious Russian assault is expected to begin any time now.

Kramatorsk is the city where a missile distributed cluster munitions onto the train station ten days ago killing more than 50 people, mostly women and children.

As we discovered, Russian troops continue to target the town. Half the population has now left but many of the rest say they will not go - ""it's our home"" one told me.

The police here are dealing with multiple challenges beyond the shelling. They patrol the city for suspected saboteurs who, they say, are photographing potential targets and sending them to the Russians on the other side. Looting is also a challenge with many people's homes now empty.

In the neighbouring city, Slovyansk, as the air raid siren wailed out, the mayor, Vadim Lyakh, told us they are holding firm despite a Russian threat to encircle the city.

Slovyansk is a symbolic prize for Russia. It was the first place the Russians captured in the 2014 war. It's proving harder this time.

Pokrovsk - 60 miles away - is now the closest place from where people can get a train out. The station at Krematorsk is shut after the attack.

And there, on platform one of Proktosk station, we saw the sheer cruelty of this war.

The 4.30 to Lviv in the west is a train full of the most vulnerable. The disabled and mentally ill. Some in wheelchairs; some carried on blankets.
