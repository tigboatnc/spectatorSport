The official said the US believes there is not any radioactive leakage.

“We don’t have a firm sense on the nature of the attack on the power plant, so I can’t give you a blow by blow of exactly how that occurred and who the Russians employed and what they employed to make that assault on the power plant. But the main thing is we don’t see any radioactive leakage,” the official said.

The US is “deeply” concerned about what the Russian intentions are regarding their control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in Ukraine, according to the official.

The official said the US does not know how many people the Russians have at the plant and what their control looks like “in terms of continuation of operations.”

The US doesn’t know the expertise of the Russians in control of the plant or what their near-term intentions are for the plant, according to the official.

“We are in no position to refute claims that they are in control of the nuclear power plant. But we don’t know exactly right now what that control means and what it looks like. So I would be loath to say that we know with specificity, you know, how many people they have there and what their control over the power plant looks like in terms of continuation of operations. And again, that’s one of the things that deeply concerns us, is that we don’t know what expertise they have, what they’ve applied to this, what their intentions are in the near term. I mean all of that is of great concern,” the official said.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-04-22/h_76a005a20084148804d81987017f15d8

It's just past 3 a.m. ET in the Ukrainian capital. If you're just reading in now, here's where things stand:

Nuclear plant on fire: Moments ago, an official reported that Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire.

So far, Firefighters are unable to reach the fire according to Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of the nearby town of Enerhodar.

Talks between Ukraine and Russia end with no breakthrough: A Ukrainian negotiator on Thursday said that a second round of talks with Russia didn’t deliver any results that Ukraine needed.

""Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors,"" senior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podolyak said in a tweet after the talks ended.

However, humanitarian corridors for civilians were agreed on during talks.

Key cities under assault: Russia is laying siege to the key Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN the southeastern city was ""surrounded"" by Russian forces and was in desperate need of military and humanitarian aid.

""Our Ukrainian army and National Guard is very brave, they stand and fight for Ukraine, for Mariupol. But the situation is quite critical,"" Orlov said Thursday.

In northeast of Ukraine, 34 civilians were killed by Russian attacks on the Kharkiv region within a 24 hour period, emergency services announced Thursday morning.

Russian troops are advancing toward Odessa, the strategically significant city on the country's southern coast.

Growing humanitarian crisis: The Russian invasion has sparked a need for humanitarian aid. Food and supplies inside the country are becoming increasingly scarce. Organizations are on the ground in Ukraine and neighboring countries to help with shelter, food, water, and additional aid.

The United Nations estimates that more than 10 million people may end up fleeing their homes in Ukraine, including four million who may cross the border into neighboring countries, according to a statement.

International response: US President Joe Biden announced additional sanctions against Russian oligarchs on Thursday.

The new list of individuals described as ""Putin's cronies and their family members"" will be cut off from the US financial system, their assets in the US will be frozen, and their property will be blocked from use, according to a fact sheet from the White House.

There will be full blocking sanctions on eight Russian elites, plus their family members and associates.

The European Union will grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, according to the bloc's Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson.

Germany must freeze assets of Russian oligarchs immediately as part of sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine,German Economy Minister Robert Habeck urged on Thursday.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-03-22/h_a0fca5117dc8c1e41c54959c420ce7e2
