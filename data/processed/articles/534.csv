1,bb9ce6c0-e784-4c22-b7b0-4731b5156a9e,[],,"Local officials in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson have described their shock and disbelief as Russian troops attacking from Crimea overwhelmed their defences.

Early on the morning of February 24, Russian soldiers were deployed from occupied Crimea. In a matter of hours, they reached Nova Kakhovka, in the centre of the Kherson region, and nearby Oleshek. By mid-morning, the Russians had seized Nova Kakhovka’s Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station and captured the North Crimean Canal in the neighbouring city of Tavriysk.

Municipal officials complained about the lack of communication with the regional and state authorities. Tavriysk mayor Mykola Rizak said that he immediately informed the leadership of the Kherson regional state administration.

“I told them about the capture of the channel, but they did not believe it,” he said. “And I have a question: how could Russian tanks, Grads and armoured personnel carriers pass from Armyansk to Tavriysk in four hours? Where is our first echelon of defence [or] the second, about which the regional authorities told us many times and reassured us that everything will be fine? Where are they?”

There was heavy fighting in the area of ​​the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station - which was occupied by Russian forces - and on the outskirts of Kherson. Wounded Russian soldiers were taken to the Novokakhovskaya city hospital and there were also civilian casualties, including at least three people killed due to shelling in Oleshki. On February 24, on a highway near the village of Tsukury in the Tavrian region, a Russian armoured personnel carrier hit a car. The passenger died at the scene, and the driver remains in critical condition.

In the late afternoon of February 25, the head of the regional state administration Gennady Laguta announced the loss of control over the Antonovsky Bridge, the main crossing to Kherson across the Dnieper from the city of Oleshki.

“The enemy overcame the city’s defences with great force and heavy losses,” he posted on Facebook. “We urge you to remain calm and not panic. The regional leadership is making every effort to maintain law and order and save lives. The situation remains tense, but we promise to do everything possible to resolve it.”

Laguta said that the situation in the Kherson region remained tense.

“In the Genichesk region, all state structures came under the control of the invaders,” he said. “Russian [military] equipment stands in Genichesk itself; on its outskirts there are checkpoints with Russian troops. They check those entering whether they belonging to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.”

Fighting continued in Nova Kakhovka. At about noon on February 25, Russian troops seized the administrative building of the Novokakhovka city council. However, a few hours later, the soldiers left the city council building, according to Nova Kakhovka mayor Volodymyr Kovalenko.

“They negotiated with me and my deputies,” he said. “They listened to our wishes, among which were to keep tanks and armoured vehicles off the city’s streets. After that, they removed the security from the building and departed in an unknown direction.”

Kovalenko said that he was working day and night to try and keep the city functioning, with all communication with the regional authority lost. Others fear a power vaccum, with some local counsellors having evacuated and the police, state security service and prosecutor's office not functioning in either Novo Kakhovka or Kakhovka.

To prevent looting, Kakhovka was patrolled by the local volunteers, and 20 representatives of the municipal security organisations helped maintain calm in Nova Kakhova.

“Regarding weapons, we had only two [non-lethal] pistols and the aim to prevent widespread looting,” said local resident Sergiy Tsigipa, one of the organisers of the local defence battalion.

“We're in hell here,” said Lyudmila Annas, the village of Vesyoloye. “Since seven in the morning on February 25, they have been bombing, there are many Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers in the village. They go everywhere: along the streets, gardens of local residents. There is a lot of Russian military equipment on the village sports fields, a whole military unit of them stands nearby. Hot shrapnel falls on the adjacent areas. People are afraid to leave the house.”

Berislav mayor Oleksandr Shapovalov told IWPR that the entire area had been left without power.

“We had an electricity blackout in the town and in all the surrounding villages. There were disruptions in supplying bread to the local hospital, however later on the 25th we started to resolve these issues.”

Roads were damaged in other large communities of the Kakhovskya district.

“Local authorities are now trying to repair these damages,” said local mayor Maksim Kolokot.

The swift progress of the invasion at first shocked the local authorities of the Kherson oblast. Mayors and local officials complained about the lack of communication with the district authorities and the lack of access to key information on the first day of the war.

For now, major infrastructure remains under the control of Russia.

“They check everyone incoming to the city whether they are members of the Ukraine army or not,” said Genadi Laguta, head of the Kherson oblast. “The Kahovskaya hydro power station is under the control of the enemy. Large military machinery also moved towards Berislav district as well as to Skadovskaya.”",https://iwpr.net/global-voices/ukraine-russian-troops-continue-offensive-crimea

Russian forces have launched an invasion of Ukraine, with troops entering the country from the east, from Belarus in the north, and Crimea in the south.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address, announcing a military operation to demilitarise and ‘de-nazify’ Ukraine.

Ukraine’s air defence systems have largely been disabled.

Multiple cities across the country have been struck by missiles and artillery shells, including Kyiv, Odessa, Kharkiv, and Mariupol.

Ukraine has declared a state of emergency and closed its airspace to all civilian traffic.

Road and rail routes out of the country are largely congested due to the number of people attempting to evacuate.

Situation

Early on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address to the nation during which he announced the commencement of a military operation to demilitarise and ‘de-nazify’ Ukraine. President Putin warned other countries against inhibiting Russia’s actions in Ukraine, stating that Russia’s actions would lead to “consequences that you have never faced in your history”. While Vladimir Putin was still talking, multiple explosions were reported around the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Following this, explosions targeted areas of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk, and more. The Russian forces subsequently launched a campaign to disable Ukraine’s air defence systems, primarily targeting military airbases.



Following the initial stages, columns of Russian ground forces entered Ukrainian territory from the east, from Belarus in the north, and from Crimea in the south. Armed clashes have occurred between Ukrainian and Russian forces in multiple areas of the country. The use of thermobaric, cruise and ballistic missile systems has been documented, primarily against military structures. One of the heaviest confrontations is believed to be around Antonov International Airport in Hostomel, approximately 25 kilometres northwest of central Kyiv. Videos have been shared online showing Russian attack helicopters surrounding the airport, with large columns of smoke emerging from the site.

Ground forces are also believed to be engaging in combat at the airport. The level of fighting in close proximity to Kyiv has raised concerns that Russian forces will attempt to capture the capital city in the coming hours. Heavy fighting has also been recorded around the Antonovskiy Bridge, leading into Kherson, and Russian forces are believed to have entered the city. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has alleged that four ballistic missiles have been fired from Belarusian territory in the southwest direction.

The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that Russian forces are attempting to gain control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, calling the action “a declaration of war against the whole of Europe”. Although the primary targets appear to be military bases and infrastructure, civilian casualties have been documented on several occasions. A video has surfaced showing a fighter jet firing at least two rockets towards a civilian housing complex. The exact figures of civilian and military fatalities are unavailable.



The previous night, Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada approved a 30-day state of emergency to be imposed at midnight. The state of emergency allows the country’s authorities to restrict freedom of movement, inspect vehicles, ""strengthen the protection of public order"", restrict the sale of alcohol and weapons, prohibit public gatherings, impose curfews, and regulate broadcast outlets. Then, following the invasion, the Ukrainian government imposed martial law and closed the country’s airspace. Currently, civilian flights are disallowed from operating services to and from Ukraine, limiting evacuation options. Multiple roads leading west have become heavily congested, due to the volume of people attempting to evacuate the country. Likewise, videos surfaced today showing large crowds queuing outside Kyiv’s main railway station (Pasazhyrskyi), implying that rail options are also congested.

Russia’s actions have been met with widespread international condemnation. The United Kingdom’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, delivers a televised address during which he denounced Russia’s actions, labelling President Putin as a “dictator”, and stated that a “massive package” of sanctions will be imposed, asserting “we will do whatever it takes” to support Ukraine. Moldova and Latvia have both declared a state of emergency, while the Finnish Prime Minister, Sanna Marin, has announced that her country is ready to apply for NATO membership, “if it becomes a matter of national security”. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, has labelled the invasion as a “brutal act of war” and announced that the bloc is increasing its presence in the eastern European members and heightening the readiness of the NATO Response Force. At an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting, each member was largely critical of the Russian invasion, and the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, stated that Russia has declared war on Ukraine.



Analysis and Implications

The Russian authorities are believed to have several objectives in conducting its invasion of Ukraine. Primarily, it is understood that Russia is seeking to remove the incumbent Ukrainian authorities from power. Russia views the post-2014 Ukrainian governments as a threat to its national security, hence the operation to demilitarise the country. It remains to be seen whether Russia will annex any more of Ukraine’s territory. However, it is probable that if Russia is successful in removing Ukraine’s administration, it will install a new pro-Russian government. In such an event, it is possible that an insurgency will be carried out by the Ukrainian population, something that is being actively encouraged by the country’s armed forces.

President Zelensky announced that Ukraine will give weapons to anyone willing to defend it, stating that people should “be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities”. If this occurs, it is possible that Russian troops could remain in Ukraine for an extended period to quell any pockets of resistance. Already, videos have surfaced showing troops from Rosgvardiya deployed inside Ukrainian territory, specifically, in Henichesk, situated in the Kherson Oblast. Rosgvardiya constitutes Russia’s domestic armed forces who have previously been deployed to Belarus in order to quell protest activities. This suggests that the Russian government is planning a long-term operation in Ukraine.



The invasion of Ukraine is already having impacts on global financial markets, and sanctions are likely to worsen the situation. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion’s commencement, the value of the Russian rouble fell by approximately 20 percent, before achieving a slight recovery. The price of oil has reached its highest level since 2014, at 105 USD per barrel. The FTSE 100 share index fell this morning by 3 percent, London-listed Russian company Sberbank’s share price fell by 61 percent and Gazprom’s fell by 28 percent. Wheat prices have also increased sharply, to approximately 390 USD per tonne, which is thought to be the largest price rise for nine years. The full scale of economic impact remains to be seen, but fuel and gas prices are expected to rise.



The risk to traveller safety is critical, civilian fatalities have been reported on multiple occasions and there is no guarantee that fighting will happen exclusively outside civilian zones. Worsening the risk, are the limited availability of transport options. With all civilian flights suspended alongside road and rail options being heavily congested, it is likely that difficulties will arise when attempting to evacuate the country. Ukrainian authorities have set up bomb shelters in the major cities, including the capital, many of which are in underground railway stations.

The United States Embassy to Ukraine currently advises that people should shelter-in-place. Both sides have accused the other of spreading lies and launching disinformation campaigns, indicating that verifiable information is limited, possibility impeding the ability of travellers to keep abreast of the current situation.





Advice

Defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine.

Ensure that travel passports and travel documents are up to date and regularly review possible departure options.

Where applicable, travellers in Ukraine should familiarise themselves with plans to evacuate the country and/or implement robust security measures.

Regularly monitor reputable national and international news reports for situational updates over the coming days and weeks, keeping in mind the rifeness of disinformation campaigns.

Marine battalion engineer Vitaly Skakun Volodymyrovych was deployed to the Henichesk bridge in the southern province of Kherson when the Russian tanks advanced, the Ukrainian military said on its Facebook page.

“On this difficult day for our country, when the Ukrainian people give way to the Russian occupiers in all directions, one of the hardest places on the map of Ukraine was the Crimean intersection, where one of the first enemies met a separate marine battalion,” according to the post.

When the battalion decided that the only way to block the armored column was by blowing up the bridge, Volodymyrovych volunteered to place mines on the span, the General Staff of the Armed Forces said.

And when he realized he had no time to get to safety, the brave soldier made the ultimate sacrifice on the bridge, which connected Russian-occupied Crimea and mainland Ukraine.

Volodymyrovych’s bravery slowed the Russian advance.

“According to his brothers in arms, Vitaly got in touch [with them] and said he was going to blow up the bridge. Immediately after an explosion rang out,” the military said.

“Our brother was killed. His heroic act significantly slowed down the push of the enemy, allowing the unit to relocate and organize the defense,” the statement said.

Today is a major day in the Russian military operation. Why?

Because Russian forces are now on the outskirts of many major Ukrainian cities. If yesterday was “standoff weapons” day, today is the first day when Russian forces can now begin to degrade Ukrainian artillery dispositions, engage Ukie armor and break through Ukrainian fortifications. Today is also the last day for US PSYOPs to try to present a counter-narrative (Ukies heroically resisting, Russian dying in huge numbers, effective counter-attacks, etc.).

Yet we live in the smartphone with camera era and picture like this one tell the full story:

What you see in this picture are immense traffic jams of folks fleeing not Mariupol or Kramatorsk, but Kiev, the capital.

Here is a quick machine translated news update from Col. Cassad:

1. LDNR – the positional nature of the fighting remains, with attempts by the LDNR armies to advance to the borders of the territories occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

2. The southern direction – the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation retained control over the bridge over the Dnieper at Kherson, repulsing attempts of counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.. Fighting in the Antonovsky Bridge area continues.

A New Kakhovka is also being held. Melitopol was taken this morning and the advance towards Berdyansk began.

3. Kharkiv direction – fighting continues on the near approaches to Kharkov. Both sides are suffering losses in people and equipment.

4. Sumy direction – the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation took Putivl and passing through Sumy (the battle at the airport continued there today), advanced to Konotop, surrounding the city. Today, attempts to take Akhtyrka continued in order to reach Kharkov from the west. There are Russian roadblocks on the Sumy-Kiev highway. There is an advance to Kiev and Chernihiv. (The APU repelled the attack of the Russian Armed Forces in the Chernihiv direction).

5. Kiev – Gostomel airfield is held by paratroopers. The APU could not dislodge them from there. This morning, tank columns of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation broke through to the near approaches to Kiev and are close to establishing direct communication with the landing. The AFU is preparing a counterattack, stating that another landing will be thrown out in the Gostomel area today. The Pentagon says that Kiev will fall in the coming days. After 10 o’clock shooting was heard in the city. Also, according to the statement of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the landing was thrown to the west of Zhytomyr. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively undermining bridges on the approaches, trying to slow down the advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,

6. In the morning, strikes continued on military facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the territory of Ukraine. A Su-27 of the Ukrainian Air Force was shot down over Kiev – according to one version by the Russian air defense system, according to another – by the Ukrainian ones. The downed “Caliber” fell on a residential building in Kiev, but there were no casualties. During the shelling of Gorlovka, a school was hit – 2 teachers were killed.

7. The AFU launched a missile attack on the Millerovo airfield on the territory of the Russian Federation. Damage is reported at the airfield, but there are no losses in aircraft.

I now leave you with an open thread, please try to stick to FACTUAL INFORMATION and please refrain from prophecies about the future or stream of consciousness about the present.

One more thing: today Putin appealed to the Ukrainian soldiers and told them not to let the Banderistas to rule over them, he basically called for them to take power and negotiate with Russia. Ukie generals need to think hard about what they will do next.

I will try to post an analysis of the day later today.

Zaraz po tym cywilny ruch lotniczy nad Ukrainą i zachodnią Rosją całkowicie zamarł, a w mediach społecznościowych pojawiły się pierwsze doniesienia o atakach lotniczych i rakietowych, które zostały poprzedzone dwoma cyberatakami.
