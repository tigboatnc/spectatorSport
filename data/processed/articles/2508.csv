A Ukrainian photojournalist who worked for a number of major Western news outlets including Reuters and the BBC has been killed by Russian forces near Kyiv, the office of Ukraine’s attorney general said Saturday.

The body of Maksym (Maks) Levin – who had been capturing the ongoing conflict – was found with two gunshot wounds in the Vyshgorod district which sits just north of the capital, the attorney general’s office said in a Facebook post, citing preliminary reports.

“According to the preliminary information, the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces killed the unarmed Maksym Levin with two gunshots,” it claimed. His next of kin have been informed, the office told CNN.

Photographer Markiian Lyseiko told CNN that he was last in touch with his friend, known as Maks, on March 12, the day before he went missing in a district north of Kyiv, where he had been reporting on the fighting and fleeing civilians.

In their final conversations, Lyseiko said that Levin had asked him to come to the Ukrainian capital so they could cover the war together.

Lyseiko, who worked alongside Levin since 2014 documenting the war in Donbas, where they embedded with Ukrainian soldiers for weeks at a time, described his friend in an interview with CNN on March 24 as an energetic and tenacious reporter, who often looked like he “had no fear.”

Since the war broke out eight years ago, Levin wanted to show the world what was happening in Ukraine, especially to Russia, Lyseiko said.

“The best way to understand Maks is to look at his work,” Lyseiko said. “When you watch Maks’ films or see his photos, you will understand him, without words.”

A criminal investigation is being carried out by the Vyshgorod District prosecutor's office into alleged violations of “laws and customs of war,” the attorney general’s office said, adding that “measures are being taken to establish all circumstances of the crime.”

Levin began working as a photojournalist in 2006, according to his bio on LensCulture, a photography resources website. He worked for Ukrainian news outlet LB.ua and was “well-known” in his field, having collaborated with Reuters, BBC, TRT World and Associated Press, according to the attorney general’s office.

In a statement online, LB.ua said Levin is survived by four sons, a civil partner and elderly parents. LB.ua said that in addition to journalism, Levin worked on dozens of photo and video projects for humanitarian organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF and UN Women.

In his bio, Levin described himself as a “documentary photographer/videographer, father, human being.”

The Reuters news agency on Saturday said it is “deeply saddened” over Levin's death.

“We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Maksym Levin, a long-time contributor to Reuters, in Ukraine,” John Pullman, Reuters' global managing editor for visuals, said in a statement to CNN.

“Maks has provided compelling photos and video from Ukraine to Reuters since 2013. His death is a huge loss to the world of journalism. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time,” Pullman said.","https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-2-22/h_246810c024cb33a7494208e827c411f0#:~:text=A%20total%20of%2036%20people,secretary%20was%20among%20the%20dead."

HIGHLIGHTS

• The World Food Programme (WFP) has assisted 1 million people in the eastern, northern and southern oblasts of Ukraine since 24 February. WFP continues to build up its food stocks in the country, pre-positioning close to 40,000 tons of bulk food, mostly procured locally, as it aims to reach more than 3 million people with food and cash assistance in the country.

• The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is supporting the procurement of more than 14 tons of liquefied chlorine for water purification to support the weekly operations of the Kharkiv Vodokanal water system (Kharkivska oblast, east). This will help ensure access to safe water for approximately 900,000 people in some of the hardest-hit areas of eastern Ukraine.

• The Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) has reached more than 400,000 people across the country with multisectoral assistance, dispatching more than 1,000 tons of aid.

• As of 31 March, nearly 18,500 people across Ukraine have received multipurpose cash assistance totaling US$3.2 million from UN agencies and humanitarian partners. As growing numbers of people are registered at a faster pace, these figures are expected to increase quickly.

• Human Rights Watch (HRW) has documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north), Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north), including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an independent investigation to bring about effective accountability, an appeal echoed by the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine Osnat Lubrani.

• In less than six weeks, the civilian death toll (1,430) of the ongoing military offensive has already surpassed the total number of civilian deaths from the last seven years of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine combined (1,320 civilians killed in 2015-2021).

SITUATION OVERVIEW

General humanitarian situation. The situation in the hard-hit eastern, northern and southern areas of Ukraine is becoming increasingly dire. Unmet needs continue to accumulate as access to food, water, medicines and other basic necessities remains severely restricted. Ongoing clashes prevent people trapped in partially or fully encircled cities from safely evacuating while simultaneously blocking much-needed aid from reaching those most in need. Some of the worst-affected areas include Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson (Khersonska oblast, south), areas surrounding Kyiv, Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), Okhtyrka (Sumska oblast, north-east), Izium (Kharkivska oblast), Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast, east), Trostianets (Sumska oblast), Volnovakha (Donetska oblast) and Sumy (Sumska oblast), as well as settlements in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts located close to the areas of active fighting.

As of 3 April, the civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive stands at 3,527 – including 1,430 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,198 casualties – including 405 killed and 793 injured – compared to 320 civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (67 killed and 253 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 2,009 civilian casualties.

In less than six weeks, the civilian death toll of the ongoing military offensive already surpassed the total number of civilian deaths from the last seven years (2015-2021) of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine combined, when around 1,320 civilians were killed. The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely much higher and will continue to rise as fighting intensifies in the eastern and southern parts of the country.

Damages and losses. The Ministry of Economy says that Ukraine’s economy shrunk by 16 per cent between January and April this year, projecting a 40 per cent decline by the end of 2022 – double of the recent projection issued by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal says that economic losses due to the ongoing military offensive may exceed $1 trillion. As of 3 April, Ukravtodor – the state-owned road construction company – estimates that around 23,000 km of roads have been damaged or destroyed, causing approximately UAH874 billion ($29.73 billion) in damage, while more than 270 road infrastructures, like bridges and overpasses, have been destroyed.

Laws-of-war violations. Between 27 February and 14 March, HRW documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv, Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital, including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia. These violations include a case of repeated rape in Kharkiv, summary executions, and unlawful violence and threats against civilians. There are also reports of looting of civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood, by the Russian Federation forces in different parts of the country. HRW says that all parties in Ukraine must abide by international law, including the Geneva Conventions, international law of occupation and international human rights law, adding that those who have committed these abuses are responsible for war crimes.

In Bucha, a small town around 30 km northwest of Kyiv, the bodies of at least 20 civilian men were found on a single street following the withdrawal of the Russian Federation forces. According to Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk, more than 300 civilianswere killed – 280 are reportedly buried in mass graves – some of whom received inhumane treatment reportedly at the hands of the Russian Federation forces. UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his shock at the gruesome images coming out of Bucha, calling for an independent investigation to bring about effective accountability, a sentiment echoed by the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine and many world leaders.

Northern Ukraine and capital area. Despite claims that the military offensive on Kyiv and surrounding areas is being scaled back, on 3 April, missile strikes hit Vasylkiv – a small town of 36,000 people about 32 km outside Kyiv – leaving several civilians injured. As the Russian Federation forces reportedly retreat from some of the hardest-hit areas in and around the capital, the extent of destruction and civilian casualties is becoming more apparent.

According to Kyiv City Council, more than 150 residential buildings and over 70 schools have been damaged since 24 February in the capital. Still, the gravest humanitarian consequences of the ongoing military offensive are seen in towns outside Kyiv, like Bucha, Irpin and Motyzhyn, where local authorities say civilians have been purposely killed, some reportedly shot in the back of the head with their hands tied behind their backs. According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, as of 3 April, at least 410 bodies have been discovered in towns near Kyiv.

In Irpin – around 25 km northwest of the capital – weeks of intense clashes have left people in desperate need of safe water, food, generators, and plastic sheets and tarpaulins to help insulate and conduct partial repairs of damaged homes.

Just 3,500 of Irpin’s 60,000 pre-escalation population remains in the ravaged town, with only the most vulnerable, including older persons and people with disabilities, still there. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reports that Irpin is only accessible by land cruiser as the streets remain littered with unexploded ordnance. On 2 April, Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said that more than 640 explosive devices were deactivated in Irpin, adding that the extent of unexploded ordnance contamination will prevent people from returning to what remains of their homes and communities for at least a month as authorities clear out large quantities of explosive devices.

In neighbouring Chernihivska oblast, the oblast capital Chernihiv – currently home to only 130,000 people after half the preescalation population fled amid escalating tensions – authorities report that there is no centralized heating and limited electricity and gas supply in the city. URCS reports that residents in Chernihiv have been without water for more than three weeks after the city’s centralized water supply was destroyed by shelling, generating acute water needs as water supplies are running out. On 3 April, the mayor of Chernihiv Vladyslav Atroshenko said that approximately 70 per cent of the city was destroyed following weeks of relentless attacks. As the humanitarian situation worsens, the city remains cut off from areas controlled by Ukraine since the main bridge over the Desna River, leading out of the city south toward Kyiv, was destroyed on 23 March, making it difficult for much-needed aid to reach those most in need.

Eastern Ukraine continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing military offensive. Fears are growing that already-violent clashes and intense shelling will only worsen as the Russian Federation forces double down on taking control of the Donbas region following a series of setbacks in their attempts to encircle Kyiv.

On 2 April, active hostilities in Lozova (Kharkivska oblast) reportedly killed at least four people and damaged homes and other critical infrastructure, leaving more than 60,000 residents cut off from the water supply and another 40,000 without electricity. That same day, the Governor of Kharkivska oblast reported that a hospital in Balakliia – a small town in the Izium district (raion) – was partially destroyed.

On 3 April, intense shelling in the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv – the country’s second-largest city – left at least seven people dead and nearly three dozen injured, including three children, according to the oblast prosecutor’s office. Additionally, at least 10 homes and a trolley bus depot were damaged. Local authorities report that other areas on the outskirts of Kharkiv were also shelled on 4 April, including Derhachi, Pyatykhatky and Saltivka. In Derhachi, on 3 April, three civilians were killed and seven others injured after a residential neighbourhood was shelled.

In Izium, the setting of the most intense clashes across Kharkivska oblast, Deputy Mayor Volodymyr Matsokin says that 80 per cent of residential buildings have been destroyed. The city and surrounding suburbs, like Kamianka, Sukha and Topalske, remain completely cut off. Around 15,000-20,000 people are still trapped in Izium, where they lack electricity, heat and safe water, and require immediate humanitarian assistance and safe evacuation corridors. Meanwhile, in Luhanska oblast, hostilities are intensifying in Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast). On 3 April, two volunteers were reportedly killed while attempting to deliver aid to affected people in Novodruzhesk (Luhanska oblast).

On 3 April, signs of an impending escalation pushed the head of the Donetska Oblast State Administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, to call on residents to leave the oblast, adding that authorities will facilitate evacuations, although active hostilities in several locations may hinder the safe movement of people. In recent days, towns across the oblast have come under constant attack, including Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka, Mariinka, Svitlodarsk and Vuhledar, while the humanitarian situation in Mariupol and Volnovakha remains acute.

Southern Ukraine. Attacks across the country’s southern oblasts, including Khersonska, Mykolaivska and Odeska, are becoming increasingly more frequent and devastating. Several missiles struck Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast) and Odesa (Odeska oblast) during the reporting period, hitting residential areas and civilian infrastructure. On 1 April, multiple missiles hit the Odeskyi district (raion) from the direction of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, leaving at least two dead and another 15 wounded.

In Mykolaiv, airstrikes on 3 April left one person dead and more than a dozen injured. As of 4 April, the civilian death toll from the 29 March attack on the Mykolaiv Oblast State Administration building has risen to 36 as search-and-rescue crews continue to comb through the rubble in search of survivors. Attacks in Mykolaiv also damaged a children’s hospital, an orphanage and an oncology centre; and at least 14 people were injured. In neighbouring Ochakiv – a port town with some 15,000 inhabitants – at least seven people were killed and nearly 20 injured by missile strikes on 3 April.

Civilian evacuations. Between 1 and 3 April, the Government of Ukraine says that nearly 13,180 people were evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors, including just over 2,000 people from Mariupol, nearly 1,170 from southeastern Zaporizka oblast (Berdiansk, Melitopol, Polohu, Orikhiv and Vasylivka) and more than 5,850 from Luhanska oblast (Kreminna, Lysychansk, Nyzhne, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk).

At the time of writing, evacuation processes for residents of Mariupol are underway, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, with 15 buses departing from Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast) en route to Mariupol and another seven from the ICRC heading from Manhush (Donetska oblast, NGCA). In Luhanska oblast, despite agreed-upon evacuation corridors out of Lysychansk, Nyzhne, Popasna and Rubizhne today, at the time of writing, continued shelling in the Hirska community (hromada), including airstrikes in Hirske, Popasna and Zolote, will likely prevent evacuations.

Meanwhile, on 3 April, the Russian Federation reported that 16,648 people, including nearly 2,442 children, were evacuated from affected areas to the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that 602,106 people, including more than 119,847 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine. In addition, the Russian Federation reports that 125,616 persons were evacuated from Mariupol to date, including 1,784 persons on 3 April.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-4-april-2022

This story contains graphic photos and video, including images of bodies found in Bucha, Ukraine. ODESSA, Ukraine — Haunting images of dead bodies littering the streets of a Kyiv suburb and reports of civilian executions are triggering new international condemnation against Russia, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded accountability for what he said amounts to “genocide.”

Ukrainian officials said they have asked the International Criminal Court to visit the mass graves seen in Bucha, a suburb northwest of the capital, so that experts can gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes. European leaders supported the call for an independent investigation and pledged to hold Russia accountable for what NATO’s secretary general described as “brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

The calls for retribution came as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be regrouping and shifting his focus away from Kyiv, near where Ukrainian forces are recapturing territory, and toward the country’s south and east.

Explosions rocked Odessa early Sunday as Russia said its missiles struck an oil refinery and fuel storage facilities — the first major strikes on the strategic Black Sea port city’s downtown. Tens of thousands of people remained cut off from desperately needed aid in Mariupol, which the Red Cross still hasn’t been able to reach.

Zelensky said Ukrainians are being “destroyed and exterminated” because they refuse to be subdued by Russian forces.

“This is genocide,” Zelensky said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities.”

Video posted to social media Saturday and verified by The Washington Post showed at least nine people, including one child, lying on the street of a residential area in Bucha. They appeared to be dead.

Human Rights Watch said in a statement Sunday that it had “documented several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations against civilians in occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine.”

A Ukrainian task force has found 410 civilian bodies in the Kyiv region, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said Sunday.

Responding to the images from Bucha, at least three top European officials — European Council President Charles Michel, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the European Union’s economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni — said they planned to impose tighter economic sanctions against Russia.

A fundamental problem, however, remains the billions of dollars’ worth of Russian oil and gas that the world continues to buy, giving the Kremlin a direct financial lifeline.

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union should discuss banning Russian gas imports, according to her ministry.

Germany has thus far opposed calls to ban Russian energy supplies, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz saying it would devastate the German and European economies.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to do “everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine.” He added that the United Kingdom would ramp up sanctions against Russia and bolster military support for Ukraine.

In a message posted on the Telegram app late Sunday, Zelensky asked for help in investigating and punishing the Russian forces he accused of committing atrocities against unarmed civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities

Zelensky also directed remarks toward mothers of Russian soldiers he accused of executing civilians.

“What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha ever do to Russia?” he said in Russian. “You couldn’t have not known that was inside your children.”

The latest brutalities have prompted Biden administration officials to discuss intensifying their sanctions campaign against Russia, according to two people familiar with the matter.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” said the images of dead civilians were a “punch to the gut.”

The Russian Defense Ministry, however, claimed no civilians were harmed while it had control of Bucha. It said, without offering evidence, that Ukrainian troops had fired in the area.

The images from Bucha “are another production of the Kyiv regime for the Western media,” the statement said. It claimed the same of an attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month, which also drew widespread condemnation.

Amid the condemnation, Russia requested a Monday meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss what Moscow’s U.N. representative, Dmitry Polyanskiy, called a “blatant provocation by Ukrainian radicals,” according to RIA, a Russian state-owned news agency.

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine were set to resume Monday, with discussions centered on Russia’s demands for Ukraine to cede Crimea and parts of the Donbas regions in the east.

Zelensky said Sunday that peace talks would require full Russian withdrawal “to their borders that existed prior to the 24th of February at least” — a statement some are interpreting as a willingness to compromise on the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine that Russia contested before the invasion.

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, though Ukraine still claims the southern peninsula as its own. The Kremlin has also backed separatists in two provinces of the Donbas region, which Putin recognized as independent before his invasion.

On Sunday, Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Telegram that the Ukrainian side had “become more realistic” in some of its stances. However, he appeared to shut down the idea of a possible meeting between Putin and Zelensky, a day after his Ukrainian counterpart said such a sit-down between the leaders was possible.

“The draft agreement is not ready for submission to a meeting at the top,” Medinsky said on Telegram, according to a Reuters translation. “I repeat again and again: Russia’s position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED.”

Moscow and Kyiv have held a number of negotiations, most recently in Istanbul, since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

As Russia’s attacks appeared to shift south, the conflict in cities on the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea are coming into focus. Military analysts think the next phase of the war will primarily be a battle for southeastern Ukraine.

Odessa has long been considered a target for the Russian military because it is an economically vital port, but with Moscow’s ground forces unable to advance past Mykolaiv, about 70 miles east, Odessa has largely been spared from attacks. Local businesses and even the zoo have reopened in the past week.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that Russia’s navy is strategically blockading the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to prevent Ukraine from rearming.

In another battered port city, Mariupol, Ukrainians will also face “difficult” fights ahead, an adviser to Zelensky warned, as Moscow vies for a strategic victory that would free up thousands of troops to fight elsewhere.

Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that high-precision sea and air missiles had destroyed an oil refinery and three fuel storage facilities near Odessa. The claim could not be immediately verified independently by The Post.

Ukrainian officials said the fire had been extinguished, but the depot had been destroyed and could “no longer function” following Sunday’s attack.

The Odessa City Council said in a statement posted on Telegram early Sunday that the city was attacked from the air and that “some missiles were shot down by air defense.” Fires were reported in some areas, and residents were advised to close their windows and stay away while emergency responders carried out their work.

After the Odessa explosions, missile strikes were recorded in two other cities in Ukraine on Sunday, local authorities said. Missile strikes were reported in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, where a Russian rocket had hit the regional administration building on Tuesday, killing at least 36 people, according to the local authorities.

“Friends, we have several missile strikes in the city,” Alexander Senkevych, the city’s mayor, wrote in a Telegram post. He noted that information is being collected and asked the public not to publish photos or videos and let official sources do so.

A Russian missile strike also was reported in the city of Vasylkiv, southwest of Kyiv, where an air defense command center was hit.

“Today, the enemy once again launched a missile strike on the city of Vasylkiv,” a unit of the Ukrainian air force reported in a post published on Facebook, noting that some of the missiles were shot down by Ukraine’s air defense systems.

According to preliminary information, several employees of the command center — which also houses a training center and an aviation school — were injured and hospitalized, one in critical condition, according to the statement. Rescue services were going through the debris in search of survivors.

To the east, in Mariupol, where Russia has already wreaked massive destruction and deprivation, a much-needed humanitarian convoy is “yet to reach the city,” the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday.

The ICRC team of three cars and nine staffers departed Zaporizhzhia — about 140 miles from Mariupol — on Saturday morning to assist with the humanitarian operation in the battered port city, where as many as 100,000 people are still trapped after weeks of heavy fighting.

The convoy attempted to reach Mariupol on Friday but had to return to Zaporizhzhia, saying the “conditions and arrangements” made it impossible to move forward, despite assurances from Moscow of a cease-fire and safe passage for civilians, the organization said in a statement.

Thousands of desperate civilians left the eastern Ukraine city of Kramatorsk on Sunday, before an anticipated Russian offensive to seize what remains of Ukrainian-controlled territory in the eastern Donbas region.

About 5,000 people — mostly women, children and the elderly — boarded trains heading to the relative safety of western Ukraine. The mood was solemn as families said goodbye to loved ones, unsure when or whether they would see them again.

“Everything changed over the past three days; more and more families are leaving,” said Julia Jiakovlea, 34, who decided to leave Saturday evening.

The Ukrainian government has for weeks been urging the White House to expand its sanctions campaign to more dramatically cut Russia off from the global economy.

Ukraine has pressed the administration to curb Russian vessels’ access to international waterways, choke off its energy exports, and sanctions far more government officials and allies of Putin. Europe continues to depend on Russian energy, and cutting off that vital financial lifeline could devastate the European economies.

But it is not clear which escalatory measures would be proportional to the gruesome scenes emerging in Ukraine. Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, said it has been long understood that human rights violations would trigger more sanctions. But he pointed out that Russian military tactics do not appear driven by U.S. sanctions, and it would be hard to design new measures commensurate with the damage done.

“The real problem they’re going to have with the sanctions response is it will be seen as insufficient pretty much no matter what you do. The humanitarian atrocity committed will always be much worse than a sanctions response,” Nephew said. “There’s nothing proportional to a massacre being committed.”

The details of the retaliatory steps being considered by the United States aren’t clear, but senior Biden officials have previously discussed potentially devastating “secondary sanctions” that would target countries that continue to trade with Russia. Officials stressed that planning was preliminary and that no decisions had been made about potential responses.

The Biden administration could also impose sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy that they have not hit so far, including mining, transportation and additional parts of the Russian financial sector.

Blinken told CNN that the United States and its European partners are discussing new sanctions to impose on Russia “every single day.” Blinken stressed that the measures so far are already projected to cause Russia’s economy to decline by 10 percent this year, but condemned Russia’s “brutality” and said more measures are likely necessary.

“These sanctions are having a big bite now. They’re going to have a big bite going forward as long as this lasts, and we are every single day making sure that they’re not only tightened, but increased,” Blinken said.

A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment. State Department spokesman Ned Price said, “We’ll continue to escalate the pressure until and unless the Kremlin relents, but we’re not going to preview specific sanctions.”

Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Russia should be isolated from international organizations and urged the Group of 20 to bar Russian officials from its summit later this year, calling it necessary punishment for the invasion of Ukraine.

“I think there is an upcoming G-20 event later in the year — I would not permit Russia to attend,” Clinton said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “And if they insisted on literally showing up, I would hope there would be a significant, if not total, boycott. The only way that we’re going to end the bloodshed and the terror that we’re seeing unleashed in Ukraine and protect Europe and democracy is to do everything we can to impose even greater costs on Putin.
