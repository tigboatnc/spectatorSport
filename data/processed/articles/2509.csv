Today, April 2, Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for thirty-eight days. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What about today?

Key points

The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue their armed aggression against Ukraine.

They are withdrawing troops in certain areas, probably in order to strengthen the grouping of the occupying forces for further offensive operations in the Sloboda, Donetsk, and Luhansk areas.

However, these areas have been hotspots every day. A group of troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repulsed 9 enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions in the past 24 hours. Our soldiers destroyed 8 tanks, 44 armored fighting vehicles, 16 units of vehicles, and 10 artillery systems.

Over the past week, the irreparable loss of personnel in the units of the so-called 2nd Army Corps amounted to about 800 people.

Our soldiers are fighting heroically for every meter of our land, the enemy's strength and motivation are exhausted, but Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksii Danilov urged Ukrainians not to fall into euphoria from the fact that Russian troops are retreating in certain directions (""our fighters' lives and Ukrainian Armed Forces' work is behind every withdrawal""). He says that the Russian army is being reformatted to launch new strikes. Danilov believes that Putin will try to win anywhere by May 9 to ""hold a victory parade."" The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council warned that there are still many fights ahead and that ""I don't advise anyone to relax.""

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, who arrived in Kyiv. ""I came to Ukraine not only to confirm our solidarity. I would also like to make sure that you have everything you need to win this war. Because if you win, the whole world will win,"" said Roberta Metsola.

Russia is a country without shame, morality, and humanity. Since the beginning of the war, the occupiers have fired on 274 hospitals and shut down 70 ambulances. 154 residential buildings, 20 private estates, 27 kindergartens, and 44 schools were damaged.

Zelenskyy completely excludes renouncing the territory for the sake of a peace agreement, he said in an interview with Fox News.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Davyd Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation to the talks, announced some important news from the talks on the telethon:

Russia has verbally accepted a project proposed by Ukraine in Istanbul , with the exception of Crimea (Kyiv is proposing to open 15-year talks on it, and Moscow is demanding recognition of its Russian status).

, with the exception of Crimea (Kyiv is proposing to open 15-year talks on it, and Moscow is demanding recognition of its Russian status). Kyiv is waiting for Russia to confirm its statements at the talks in writing.

Negotiations are underway with China through diplomatic channels to make it a guarantor of Ukraine. But, according to Arakhamia, the issue with China has been worked out less than with other countries.

We will not sign any document where Russia will have the right to veto the decision with its vote, added Arakhamia.

He also said that ""we want to make our own NATO.""

Trophies of the Armed Forces

Resistance forces in Shestovytsia, Chernihiv region, replenished armored personnel carriers for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine has successfully used Starstreak, a missile that strikes targets with three kinetic darts. Thus, a Russian helicopter was shot down in the Luhansk region.

During the fighting in the Kyiv direction, one of the units of the National Guard of Ukraine acquired trophy Russian equipment SAU 2C -3 and MT-LB. Ukrainian defenders have already towed them to the rear. After minor repairs, the equipment will strengthen the unit fighting in this direction.

And in this photo, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces Resistance Movement are inspecting a Russian helicopter shot down by soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

Humanitarian corridors

Today, Saturday, April 2, 2022, 7 evacuation routes have been agreed upon:

Donetsk region: Private transport: Mariupol – Manhush – Berdiansk – Tokmak – Vasylivka – Kamianske – Zaporizhzhia

Zaporizhzhia region: Berdiansk – Tokmak – Vasylivka – Kamianske – Zaporizhzhia

22:00 – Today, 4,217 people were evacuated from Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions on April 2, said the head of the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk.

Atomic and chemical threats

Russia will not attack nuclear facilities in Ukraine. The head of the IAEA Rafael Grossi is sure of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency will start assisting Ukraine in maintaining the safety of nuclear facilities. Regarding reports of exposure of the Russian military to the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Grossi said the agency had contacted its Russian counterparts for more information.

Most likely, in the near future, Russia may decide to conduct a chemical attack on Ukraine. Therefore, Ukraine should be prepared for such a scenario. This is the opinion of Oleksii Danilov, Head of the Council of Experts on Energy Security. ""You know that, despite the ban on all international institutions on the use of chemical weapons, they used it in Syria at one time. We have a clear awareness that they can do it in our country. We must be ready for that,"" he said.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The United States will provide Ukraine with equipment to protect against possible chemical attacks, the White House said. ""In an effort to help our Ukrainian partners, the US government is providing the Ukrainian government with rescue tools and materials that could be deployed in the event of Russia's use of chemical or biological weapons,"" said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

News from partners

American actor Sean Penn appealed to billionaires around the world to help Ukraine. Penn is asking billionaires to spend $300 million and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 fighters for Ukraine, which would have a qualitative advantage over Russian Su and MiG fighters. He also called for $200 million worth of missile defense systems for Ukraine, for a total of half a billion dollars.

US President Biden said more than 30 countries had decided to release oil from their reserves to lower prices. He added that various states have united to prevent Russia from ""turning energy resources into weapons"" against the United States, Europe, and other countries.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria has declared the first secretary of the Russian embassy in Sofia persona non grata. He is suspected of espionage. A Russian diplomat has 72 hours to leave Bulgaria.

Following Bulgaria, the German government is considering expelling ""a significant number"" of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.

The Pope has already abandoned Moscow's terminology, calling a ""special military operation"" a war. Today, he condemned ""unjustified aggression"" by Russia and ""atrocities"" in the war. ""Again, a dictator, unfortunately, entangled in anachronistic statements about nationalist interests, provokes and inflames conflicts, while ordinary people feel the need to build a future that will either be common or non-existent,"" Francis told Maltese officials.

What's in Russia?

In Ukraine, the Russian military will be paid for voluntarily transferring usable military equipment to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Verkhovna Rada voted in favor of the document. The Russian military is guaranteed the right to keep secret the fact of transferring equipment, obtaining new documents with new installation data and security of their stay in Ukraine, as well as creating conditions for travel to a safe third country. Very good offer!

On April 1 this year, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation decided to hold a military meeting with reservists from April 4 to May 23, 2022. The redeployment of Russian troops and units of the so-called Transnistrian-Moldavian Republic in order to prepare for a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine was also noted.

There are many forbidden words and expressions in Putin's Russia. They even arrest people for the inscription on the sausage package:

""In unrecognized Transnistria, rumors are spreading about the coercion of army personnel to take part in the war against Ukraine,"" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said.

Panic is also spreading among Russian servicemen because of radiation exposure of personnel based in the Chornobyl zone. The population of Bragin, Belarus, is advised to avoid contact with the Russian occupiers who have left the contaminated area.

What about Belarus?

About 25 missiles were launched from Belarus to Ukraine last night alone. This was reported by the media and Belarusian telegram channels.

Russian lies

On March 15, Solovyov stated in his telegram channel to all of Russia that the legendary Canadian sniper Vali, who was fighting on the side of Ukraine, had allegedly been killed by Russian special forces. As a real sniper, Vali showed endurance, and two weeks later showed a photo greeting to Solovyov and all those who rejoiced at his ""death."" He posted a photo with a Russian C-ration of racists.

In Russia, a video is being distributed where an Azovstal employee allegedly wants to join the occupiers' armed forces. This was reported in the Mariupol City Council: ""They took an actor, invented his name and position and called him an Azov resident. It is said that an employee of the plant allegedly wants to join the ranks of murderers."" Azovstal HR has raised the base of all employees of all Metinvest Group companies over the years. As it turned out, a person with this name and surname had never worked at the company.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Ritter Sport has started to have problems selling products in Europe. Earlier, the company refused to leave Russia and even stated that it would develop its business there. Buyers did not like it very much, but the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany Andrii Melnyk added a special reputation, inventing a new slogan for Ritter Sport: ""Quadratisch, praktisch, Blut"" (Square, practical, bloody). The slogan has literally spread on the Internet and is already threatening to collapse sales across Europe. Now it's not about sanctions, it's about principles.

Oil giant Shell will not be able to pay for gas delivery under the new Kremlin scheme, as the UK has put Gazprombank under sanctions.

But Moldova has decided to ""maintain neutrality"" and will not join the sanctions imposed on Russia, President Maia Sandu told Radio Europa Liberă. This is a decision of a small country, which allegedly does not affect anything and does not want to irritate a large country. Unfortunately, this does not work with Russia. It always wants blood.

Russian gas is no longer supplied to the Baltic States, said Uldis Bariss, chairman of the board of the natural gas system operator Conexus Baltic Grid.

The supply of champagne from France to Russia was stopped after the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The prospects are unknown, said the director-general of the Union of French Champagne Houses (UMC) David Chatillon. But we believe there are no secrets here. Hawthorn tincture instead of champagne is the prospect in Russia.

The largest scientific publishers have decided to close access to their database of articles in Russia. At the same time, publishing houses will continue to publish articles by Russian and Belarusian scientists. The relevant statement was published on March 31.

Life considering hostilities

Ukraine has created a service for sending e-mails after the war. Messages are stored in a secure database, and after the war, the developers will automatically send them to recipients. ""Write something important today to those you think about, and after the war, they will receive your letter. You can even write to yourself as a memory of those times,"" the authors of the idea comment.

260,000 temporarily displaced people have registered with the social security authorities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a Cabinet meeting today. If we take into account that, according to the UN, at least 10.5 million people in Ukraine have currently moved out of their homes, only 2.5% have registered.

Kyiv and region

Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klychko has said that the bombing of the Ukrainian capital's satellite cities continues, despite Russia's promises to withdraw troops from the region. On Sky News, Klychko said that the fighting continues in Brovary, east of Kyiv.

Ukrainian helicopters have carried out a strike on a fuel storage facility in Russia’s western town of Belgorod, some 40 kilometres from the border, according to the local governor. Ukraine would neither confirm nor deny the attack.

Peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials resume via video, but Moscow warns that the helicopter attack will hamper negotiations.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia is preparing “powerful strikes” in the country’s east and south, including Mariupol.

Ukraine’s troops begin to regain control including around the capital Kyiv and in the southern region of Kherson — the only significant city that Russia had managed to occupy.

Russian soldiers were likely exposed to radiation while they were occupying the area around the Chernobyl nuclear power station over the past four weeks, Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom says.
