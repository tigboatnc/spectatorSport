In a statement posted to the Taliban's official Twitter account, which now goes by the name of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the militant group said it was concerned 'about real possibility of civilian casualties.'

Under the seal of the Emirate's Ministry of Foreign Affairs - that closely resembles the seals used by US government departments - the Taliban called for dialogue to be held between Russia and Ukraine and to safeguard Afghans in Ukraine.

The Taliban, as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, has yet to be recognised by any country as Afghanistan's new government since its brutal takeover in August.

Its foreign ministry posted its 'Statement concerning crisis in Ukraine' on Friday morning, and was shared on Twitter by key Taliban figures.

'The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and expresses concern about real possibility of civilian casualties,' the statement said.

'The Islamic Emirate calls for restraint by both parties. All sides need to desist from taking positions that could intensify violence.'

According to estimates, over 1,000 civilians were killed and over 2,000 injured when the Taliban launched their offensive to capture Afghanistan last year.

A further 1,500 Afghanistan forces were killed, while the now-defunct Afghan government claimed to have killed almost 10,000 Taliban militants.

UN figures also suggest as many as 244,000 civilians were displaced.

The statement continued: 'The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, in line with its foreign policy of neutrality, calls on both sides of the conflict to resolve the crisis through dialogue and peaceful means.

'The Islamic Emirate also calls on parties to the conflict to pay attention to safeguarding the lives of Afghan students and migrants in Ukraine.'

According to CNN, 370 Afghans fled their home country last year to Ukraine.

They now find themselves at risk of being caught up in yet another conflict, just months after escaping the deadly advance of the Taliban.

Since the Taliban's takeover, there have also been reports of a militant-led crackdown on civilians who worked with the western-back Afghanistan government, as well as on human rights - and particularly on women's rights.

As the Taliban released the statement on Friday, the United Nations condemned the killing of eight polio workers by unknown gunmen in Afghanistan, which it said had set back the campaign to eradicate the disease in the country.

The Taliban, who took control of the country in August, said there were separate attacks on Thursday in northeastern Kunduz and Takhar provinces.

The killings were the first since UNICEF and the World Health Organisation launched a nationwide polio vaccine campaign in November aimed at reaching over 3 million children, with the backing of the Taliban.

The Ministry of Public Health said the victims included four women.

The United Nations said the killings had led to the suspension of the vaccination campaign in the two provinces.

'We are appalled by the brutality of these killings, across four separate locations,' the U.N. said in a statement. 'This senseless violence must stop immediately, and those responsible must be investigated and brought to justice.'

The public health ministry statement said authorities were investigating.

Polio has been virtually eliminated globally through a decades-long inoculation drive. But insecurity, inaccessible terrain, mass displacement and suspicion of outside interference have hampered mass vaccination in Afghanistan and some areas of Pakistan.

Meanwhile, Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases.

Troops and tanks are moving in from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting.

Ukraine's president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his democratically elected government, cause massive casualties and ripple out damage to the global economy.

Among the signs that the Ukrainian capital was increasingly threatened, the military said Friday that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district of Kyiv about 3 miles north of the city centre.

Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some uniforms and were heading toward the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10551037/The-TALIBAN-call-Russia-Ukraine-resolve-crisis-peaceful-means.html

7,256f73a6-0d8d-4eea-8628-d4054949944a,[],2022-02-24 13:20:33+00:00,"Durante l’ultima settimana di marzo, diversi importanti media occidentali hanno pubblicato articoli sul Battaglione Azov dell’Ucraina, cercando di nascondere quasi un decennio di articoli precedenti che identificavano chiaramente le simpatie e l’etica nazista del gruppo ora divenuto reggimento inserito nelle Forze Armate Ucraine.

Si è trattato di sforzo sincrono, con pezzi usciti in USA, Germania, Regno Unito e ovviamente in Italia, dove si era già impegnati da settimane a cantare le gesta dei portatori della svastica, la cui ideologia neonazista è stata apertamente, pateticamente negata dai grandi nomi della TV, mentre sparivano misteriosamente alcuni articoli del 2014 sulla componente nazista di Maidan.

Tale sforzo era concertato per trasformare Azov in eroico difensori dell’Ucraina (raffinato pure: i pennivendoli ci hanno raccontato che leggono Kant!) contro i presunti «veri» fascisti, che sarebbero ovviamente i russi, con Putin nel ruolo del nuovo Hitler.

Il 27 marzo è stato messo in circolazione un video di dieci minuti, dall’emittente statale britannica BBC in cui il presentatore Ros Atkins ha cercato di sfatare le «falsità» russe sui nazisti in Ucraina. L’argomento è il solito: come può l’Ucraina essere «tenuta in ostaggio» dai nazisti quando il suo presidente, Volodymyr Zelensky, è ebreo, sostiene Atkins, indicando il suo 73% dei voti, alle ultime elezioni, e dichiarando trionfante che «nessun gruppo di estrema destra ha alcun potere politico formale in Ucraina».

Ovviamente, la BBC ignora – o meglio, finge di ignorare – il tema del «giudeobanderismo», ossia la collusione delle forze neonaziste con l’oligarcato ucraino, come nel caso di Igor Kolojskij, già governatore dell’oblast’ di Dnipro e oligarca di religione ebraica chegiudeobanderismo di estrema destra, oltre che la carriera televisiva e poi politica di Zelens’kyj, la cui serie Servo del popolo, bovinamente ora riproposta alla massima vaccina italiota dalla TV di Cairo, andò in onda proprio sul canale di Kolomjskij 1+1.

Tuttavia, ci colpisce, nel discorso della BBC, l’espressione «potere formale», che assomiglia tanto ad una excusatio non petita.

Come nota RT, una volta che a sciacquare i nazi è partita la BBC, il resto è seguito.

Due giorni dopo, il 29 marzo, il Financial Times ha pubblicato un articolo che descriveva Azov come «la chiave dello sforzo di resistenza nazionale» , pur riconoscendo che Azov è stato creato nel 2014 «da volontari con tendenze politiche nazionaliste e spesso di estrema destra», il FT si scrollava di dosso i suoi legami nazisti.

Quindi, i simboli nazisti usati dall’unità venivano descritti come «ora rivendicati come simboli pagani da alcuni membri del battaglione». Come riportato da Renovatio 21, Azov contiene molti entusiastici cultori del neopaganesimo paleoslavo, detto anche rodnoverismo, al punto che il battaglione aveva eretto a Mariupol’ un tempio del dio del tuono slavo Perun.

Nel paganesimo rodnoverico abbondano forme piuttosto simili alle svastiche, chiamate kolovrat.

Tuttavia, negare che Azov non faccia uso di simboli letteralmente appartenuti al nazismo è una menzogna evidente.

Il simbolo del «Sole Nero» (noto anche come Sonnenrad) risale a un mosaico commissionato negli anni ’30 dal capo delle SS Heinrich Himmler, mentre la runa Wolfsangel sovrapposta – vista nella storia della Germania, mica in Ucraina – è stata utilizzata da diversi reggimenti della Wehrmacht e delle SS , così come dai nazisti olandesi, durante la seconda guerra mondiale.

Il Financial Times va oltre. Il giornale economico arriva a dire che Stepan Bandera – il famigerato nazionalista ucraino che cercò di collaborare con la Germania nazista (con alterna fortuna) e che supervisionò l’omicidio di massa di polacchi e russi – era «un leader nazionalista che si è opposto agli sforzi nazisti e sovietici per impedire l’indipendenza dell’Ucraina».

Il 29 marzo entra in campo la CNN: Azov ha una «storia di tendenze neonaziste, che non sono state del tutto estinte dalla sua integrazione nell’esercito ucraino», ma è «una forza combattente efficace». L’ala politica di Azov ha ottenuto appena il 2,15% dei voti nel 2019. E ricordiamoci sempre, mi raccomando, che Zelens’kyj è ebreo, e mai difenderebbe quindi uomini con simboli nazisti.

RT nota che la CNN menzionano il fondatore dell’Azov Andryj Biletsky, il quale un tempo avrebbe affermato di voler «guidare le razze bianche del mondo in una crociata finale». L’emittente russa nota tuttavia che la CNN ha tralasciato la parte che dice che tale crociata sarebbe «contro gli Untermenschen guidati dai semiti».

Poi la CNN cita l’Azov che nega che l’abbia mai detto, e comunque «non hanno nulla a che fare con le sue attività politiche e il partito dei Cropi Nazionale», anche se la stessa CNN lo descrive come «l’ala politica» di Azov.

La CNN si perita quindi di far saltar fuori una citazione del 2019 di Arsen Avakov (ministro della polizia nel governo post-Maidan) in cui afferma che le accuse di nazisteria sono «un tentativo deliberato di screditare» lo Azov e l’esercito ucraino tutto. Si tratta di quello stesso Avakov che il rabbino capo dell’Ucraina, Yaakov Bleich, ha criticò nel novembre 2014, dicendo «continuava «a nominare persone di dubbia reputazione e ideologie contaminate dal fascismo e dall’estremismo di destra».

Una menzione la merita il giornale londinese Telegraph, che canta le gesta degli azoviti con prosa febbrile:

«Mentre la maggior parte delle forze armate ucraine è stata silenziosamente impegnata nella routine di un estenuante tiro alla fune con la Russia, un battaglione è stato impegnato a pubblicare video e immagini accattivanti che strombazzavano i propri successi. In una fotografia pubblicata questa settimana, un uomo corpulento in uniforme blu scuro giace privo di sensi sul terreno innevato, il fianco destro incrostato di sangue: “Azov ha eliminato un generale maggiore! E della tua spada vivrai!” si legge nella didascalia»

Il Telegraph denuncia «l’obiettivo di lunga data dei tentativi di propaganda del Cremlino di diffamare tutti gli ucraini come neonazisti» elogiando «la ben oliata macchina di pubbliche relazioni ben oliata che ha prodotto i video di guerra probabilmente della migliore qualità dell’Ucraina con i droni delle telecamere che catturano perfettamente gli attacchi mentre accadono in tempo reale. Le forze armate ucraine hanno felicemente utilizzato i video di Azov come prova visiva dei contrattacchi del Paese contro l’esercito invasore».

Nel pezzo, il fondatore di Azov Andriy Biletsky è descritto come «una figura politica ultranazionalista che aveva avuto problemi con la legge ed è stata coinvolta in vari gruppi che giocavano con i simboli nazisti». Viene quindi mostrata l’immagine di una svastica sul muro di un ufficio Azov a Mariupol, che ammettono sia occupato dai nazisti.

Si aggiunge, dulcis in fundo, che «i combattenti Azov nell’est si sono felicemente rimboccati le maniche per mostrare i tatuaggi nazisti ai corrispondenti stranieri».

E via: nazishaqquati al volo nonostante i tattoo indelebili.

C’è poi il caso Times di Londra che il 30 marzo manda in stampa un articolo che si apre con l’emozionante descrizione del funerale di un soldato Azov ucciso nei combattimenti fuori Kiev.

«Anche loro respingono l'[accusa di far uso di] iconografia nazista come forse radicata nella “fede pagana originale” dell’Ucraina , sebbene ammettano «il marchio di fabbrica di Azov. il Wolfsangel, era usato anche dalla Germania nazista».

«Siamo patrioti ma non nazisti», è il virgolettato messo in bocca ad un miliziano. Il Times cita infine un comandante Azov a Mariupol’, che accusa i russi di essere «i veri nazisti del 21° secolo». Una grande fantasia, un concetto non ripetuto da nessun altra parte.

Il lavaggio degli ucronazisti contrasta assai con la copertura che di Azov davano le testate occidentali prima del 2022. Nel gennaio 2021, la rivista Time li definiva una milizia che aveva «addestrato e ispirato suprematisti bianchi di tutto il mondo».

«Azov è molto più di una milizia. Ha il suo partito politico; due case editrici; campi estivi per bambini; e una forza di vigilanza nota come Milizia Nazionale, che pattuglia le strade delle città ucraine insieme alla polizia», ​​afferma l’articolo del Time magazine, rilevando che «ha anche un’ala militare con almeno due basi di addestramento e un vasto arsenale di armi, da droni e veicoli corazzati a pezzi di artiglieria».

Vediamo quindi parafrasate anche le parole del «capo della sensibilizzazione internazionale» (sic) azovita, che durante un tour del 2019 alla Casa cosacca avrebbe detto che la missione del gruppo era quella di «formare una coalizione di gruppi di estrema destra in tutto il mondo occidentale, con il massimo obiettivo di prendere il potere in tutta Europa».

Sempre Time scrive del passato del Biletskyj, soprannominato Bely Vozhd, cioè «Sovrano Bianco»: «la polizia ucraina trattava da tempo la sua organizzazione, Patriot of Ukraine, come un gruppo terroristico neonazista» afferma l’antica e prestigiosa rivista di Nuova York, dicendo che il loro «manifesto sembrava attingere la sua narrativa direttamente dall’ideologia nazista».

«Persino Bellingcat, un “collettivo di intelligence open source” che apparentemente funge da canale per l’agenda dell’intelligence britannica, ha sollevato bandiere rosse su Azov» ricorda RT.

Nell’ottobre 2019, Bellingcat si lamenta di come i militanti abbiano spinto Zelens’kyj – che, come riportato da Renovatio 21, potrebbe essere in questo stesso momento politicamente, fisicamente e psicologicamente ostaggio di formazioni neonaziste – a non ritirarsi dal Donbass come richiesto dagli accordi di Minsk. Il lettore nostro ricorderà le parole di uno dei capi dell’estrema destra, ora inabissatosi nell’apparato del potere statale e militare di Kiev, al momento dell’elezione di Zelens’kyj: «Zelen’kyj ha detto nel suo discorso inaugurale che era pronto a perdere ascolti, popolarità, posizione… No, perderà la vita. Sarà appeso a qualche albero del Khreshchatyk, se tradirà l’Ucraina e quelle persone che sono morte durante la Rivoluzione e la Guerra».

Bellingcat va oltre, e ci aiuta a spiegare quella storia del «potere formale» tirata fuori dalla BBC. Sebbene i «gruppi di estrema destra» abbiano «un appoggio popolare trascurabile e un potere elettorale praticamente inesistente», essi «continuano ad avere successo integrandosi nella politica e nella società ucraine». Bingo: qualcuno ci è arrivato. Ci hanno venduto la palla del fatto che, non avendo più nemmeno un seggio a differenza di quelli conquistati nel 2019, le formazioni dell’ultradestra ucraina non hanno potere; ci hanno quindi venduto la seconda palla: una volte entrati nell’esercito, gli elementi neonazi dei battaglioni sono stati purgati.

Potrebbe essere vero piuttosto il contrario: i capi neonazisti non hanno più bisogno dei (pochi) seggi ottenibili alla Rada, il Parlamento di Kiev, perché essi sono riusciti ad inserirsi ad un livello più decisivo, cioè nello Stato profondo ucraino – quello che, giocoforza, risponde al Deep State di Washington. E per quanto riguarda l’esercito, possiamo pensare che, al contrario, gli elementi nazisti possono aver contaminato le Forze Armate, garantendo peraltro una radicalizzazione ideologica invitante quando capita di dover andare al fronte.

Abbiamo già visto questo giuochino: terroristi, zeloti radicali, nemici del popolo, reietti della Storia… improvvisamente divengono guerriglieri per bene cui dare tutto il nostro supporto.

«Questa non è esattamente la prima volta che i media corporativi e statali in Occidente si nascondono dietro un gruppo che fino a poco tempo fa avevano descritto – correttamente – come estremista» scrive RT. «Ad esempio, proprio l’anno scorso, la televisione pubblica statunitense ha cercato di nascondere la realtà degli affiliati di Al-Qaeda in Siria –il Fronte Al-Nusra, in seguito ribrandizzato comodamente Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, dimodoché è stato possibile definirla sui giornali e nei corridoi del potere americano «ribelli moderati». Non islamisti, non takfiri, non jihadisti, non terroristi: ma no, sono «ribelli moderati», così come i neonazisti sono divenuti combattenti per la libertà.

Qualcosa va scritto anche riguardo alla stampa del Paese più simbolicamente interessato dal cortocircuito neonazista: la Germania.

Il sito di notizie in lingua inglese dell’emittente pubblica Deutsche Welle ha pubblicato un articolo sulla Brigata Azov dove si sostiene che mentre le organizzazioni naziste sono fuorilegge in Germania, in Ucraina un tale legge non c’è. DW sente tale Andreas Umland dello Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies, il quale ammette che le associazioni formate dalla destra in Ucraina sarebbero state descritte come gruppi neonazisti organizzati in Germania.

Lo specialista nota che l’Azov ha attirato subito l’attenzione utilizzando il simbolo nazista Wolfsangel come emblema. «Il Wolfsangel ha connotazioni di estrema destra, è un simbolo pagano usato anche dalle SS», assicura. «Ma non è considerato un simbolo fascista dalla popolazione in Ucraina».

«Normalmente, consideriamo pericoloso l’estremismo di destra, qualcosa che può portare alla guerra», dice l’esperto svedese, ma in Ucraina è il contrario, assicura.

Difficile racapezzarsi.

Niente, tuttavia, in confronto a quello che stiamo vedendo in Italia: il Paese dell’ANPI, dell’antifascismo perenne, della XII disposizione transitoria e finale della Costituzione italiana, dei senatori a vita passati per i lager etc.

Il Paese della legge Mancino ora sta fornendo armi a quell’esercito pieno di svastiche e simboletti da mistica del III Reich, nei tatuaggi, nelle mostrine, nelle bandiere. Qualcuno, in realtà si è domandato anche da noi se queste armi non finiscano, per caso, ai neonazisti – ma viene subissato di pernacchie e storielle (la svastica è un antico simbolo indiano…). Di certo, sappiamo che molte della armi che il nostro governo sta mandando non finiscono ai Foreign Fighter, che come abbiamo visto lamentano di essere mandati al fronte praticamente disarmati o con un fucile e dieci colpi in caricatore.

Altro che: alla denazificazione virtuale dei giornali di tutto il mondo che stanno dicendo che in Ucraina nessuno è nazista, corrisponde una nazificazione materiale.

Armare i nazisti…? A breve sarà il 25 aprile. L’anno passato e il precedente abbiamo riso a quelli che ci parlavano di liberazione mentre eravamo costretti a casa dal lockdown.

Quest’anno siamo andati molto più in là: l’umorismo nero di chi magari ci vuole raccontare che la resistenza, in Ucraina, la fanno gli uomini con la svastica.

Viviamo tempi incredibili. Non sempre divertentissimi.",https://www.renovatio21.com/immagini-video-dal-primo-giorno-di-guerra/
