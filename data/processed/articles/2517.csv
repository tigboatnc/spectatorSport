Over the last few months, the Administration has been working closely with Congress to produce a comprehensive funding bill that will keep the government open and ensure Federal agencies have the resources necessary to advance critical national priorities—from combatting the opioid epidemic and making housing more affordable, to supporting cutting-edge medical research and ensuring military readiness here and abroad. As part of the agreement lawmakers are working to finalize ahead of the March 11th deadline, we’re also urging Congress to include supplemental funding for two urgent and immediate needs: supporting Ukraine, and continuing our ongoing COVID response efforts.

As the President and bipartisan members of Congress have made clear, the United States is committed to supporting the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and democracy. The United States has provided over $1.4 billion in assistance to Ukraine since 2021, and, together with our European allies and partners, we are holding Russia accountable for its unjustified and unprovoked invasion. To continue this important work and further support the Ukrainian people, we are requesting $10 billion to deliver additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks. These resources will mean additional defense equipment for Ukraine, lifesaving humanitarian assistance — such as emergency food assistance — for the Ukrainian people, stronger sanctions enforcement, a dedicated task force led by the Department of Justice to go after the ill-gotten gains and other illicit activities of the Russian oligarchs, and additional support for U.S troop deployments to neighboring countries. Resources will also bolster regional efforts to counter Russian cyberattacks and disinformation, and strengthen the stability of Ukraine’s electrical grid by integrating it with the European Network of Transmission System of Operators.

In addition, we are urging Congress to include supplemental resources for the COVID-19 response. Resources from the prior COVID response bills enabled us to get over 215 million Americans fully vaccinated, make 1 billion tests available to Americans for free, order 20 million antiviral treatment pills so that they will be available to people who need them, and commit to donating 1.2 billion vaccines to the world. They also let us respond forcefully to the Delta and Omicron surges – but now, nearly all of these funds have been used. Without additional resources, we won’t be able to secure the treatments, vaccines, and tests Americans need in coming months and fight future variants. And critical COVID response efforts – such as free community testing sites and testing, treatment, and vaccination coverage for uninsured individuals – will end this spring. We are therefore urging Congress to promptly provide $22.5 billion to cover immediate needs for tests, treatments and vaccines, investments in research and development of next-generation vaccines, and responding globally, including getting more shots in arms around the world.

These funding needs are based on our best information at this time, and we will remain in touch with Congress in the coming weeks and months as we assess any additional resource requirements. Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, additional needs may arise over time. Likewise, while the funding in this request will allow us to initiate action on the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan announced yesterday, additional funding will be needed.

Importantly, the resource requirements identified in this request assume that Congress will also act promptly to provide agencies with full-year appropriations. The absence of full-year appropriations would continue to constrain Department of Defense (DOD) resources, readiness, and operations around the globe, and also leave the U.S. more vulnerable to other potential adversaries exploiting the global situation. Absent full-year appropriations, State and USAID also will not have the full range and scope of resources necessary to respond quickly and efficiently to the emerging and evolving needs in Ukraine and across the region. And the success of our COVID-19 response depends on sufficient resources for core capacity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and other public health agencies.

I’m looking forward to continued engagement with members of both parties to secure the funding necessary for the work ahead.

“Having that in there is helpful, both in terms of votes, but also probably in terms of timing,” he added.

White House officials initially floated a $6.4 billion request for Ukraine, but lawmakers in both parties quickly called for more aid as Russian forces bombarded the country.

The $10 billion request includes $4.8 billion in additional funds for the Pentagon to cover the deployment of U.S. troops to NATO countries, to increase intelligence and cybersecurity support, and to replenish the military’s supply of weapons in response to arms being sent to Ukraine.

The request also includes $4.25 billion in new funding for economic and humanitarian assistance to help provide support for Ukrainians, including the one million refugees who have already fled the country in the first week of President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion. And it includes money to enforce some of the economic penalties that the Biden administration has already imposed, including sanctions on Russian oligarchs and restrictions on Russia’s access to high-tech goods.

The request for additional Pentagon funding may sour a number of conservative lawmakers, who have argued that the bulk of any new military aid should be spent on sending new lethal aid to Ukraine, rather than the deployment of additional U.S. troops or the replenishment of U.S. stockpiles of weapons.

And Republicans were quick to pan the request for $22.5 billion in coronavirus aid, arguing that Congress already allocated plenty of money for responding to the pandemic in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package that was enacted last year without any Republican votes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/white-house-ukraine-pandemic-aid.html

The Biden administration has asked Congress to approve $32.5 billion to bolster Ukraine against Russian aggression and shore up the United States in the battle against the coronavirus, though early schisms emerged Thursday after Republicans repeated their objections to another round of pandemic aid. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The official request arrived as Democrats and Republicans continued to tussle over a broader aid package that many lawmakers hope to append to a still-forming deal to fund the government. Absent imminent action, critical federal agencies and programs are set to run out of money after March 11, imperiling Washington’s ability to respond to both crises in full.

To aid Ukraine, the Biden administration called on lawmakers to approve $10 billion, hoping to address the emerging humanitarian crisis in the country in the face of a worsening Russian onslaught. The proposal also included assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, protect its electrical grid from disruption, and further equip other European allies, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the plans.

For the pandemic, meanwhile, the Biden administration requested about $22.5 billion from Congress to replenish key public health programs as a safeguard against future variants of the coronavirus, the people said. Top White House officials have maintained in recent days that they have enough funding to combat the waning omicron surge. But they have stressed that significant money has been spent or committed to specific purposes, warranting new investment in testing, therapeutics and vaccines to protect against the possibility of a new wave.

The fate of the two spending requests rests in the hands of Congress, where lawmakers have raced in recent days to cobble together a widely sought — and repeatedly delayed — long-term deal to fund the government. Talks have progressed, but disagreements remain, including over the size and scope of the emergency aid that might be attached to the deal, known in congressional parlance as an omnibus.

On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced a “snag” in talks over Ukraine assistance, attacking Democrats for trying to source the money from sums they already planned to apportion for the Pentagon. A day later, dozens of Republicans questioned whether additional coronavirus aid is necessary, arguing that the Biden administration has not fully accounted for existing spending, including the $1.9 trillion package adopted last year.

The Biden administration sought to assuage those concerns in the request it is transmitting to Congress. The Ukraine money would be new, emergency aid, not repurposed dollars meant for the Defense Department. And the funds set aside for the coronavirus reflect immediate needs, particularly because some existing programs to help uninsured Americans obtain tests and vaccinations are set to expire this spring, according to one of the people familiar with the administration’s thinking.

But it remained unclear whether it would be enough to satisfy Republicans, particularly those who still question whether more pandemic-related spending is necessary at a time when infections are waning. In both cases, though, senior administration officials said the fast-evolving nature of both crises could force them to seek additional funds in the weeks ahead.

“Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, I anticipate that additional needs may arise over time,” Shalanda Young, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a letter to lawmakers obtained by The Washington Post. She added that she anticipates “additional funding will be needed to support the covid-19 response,” as well.

For now, the clock is ticking: Lawmakers have until the end of next week to finalize the emergency spending measures and broker a broader government funding deal, though they can still buy themselves additional time with another stopgap. Top Democrats and Republicans have insisted they have made progress in recent weeks, with Sen. Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), the top Republican on his chamber’s appropriations panel, telling reporters Wednesday that negotiators “haven’t sealed anything, but we’re moving positively.”

Without such a deal, Young, the acting OMB director, warned of significant consequences. In her missive, dated Wednesday, she said a failure to act could “constrain” the Pentagon and its readiness while preventing a wide array of agencies from carrying out efforts to combat the coronavirus, including a new administration initiative to bolster the delivery of tests and antiviral drugs.

Initially, the Biden administration had asked lawmakers to provide about $6.4 billion in response to Ukraine, hoping to boost programs at the State Department and Pentagon in response to the geopolitical crisis. The money was meant to shore up the country at a time when the president had joined with the international community in levying historic sanctions against Russia and key Kremlin-aligned figures. At the time, top officials warned that their ask could change as conditions on the ground warranted.

Soon, though, Democrats and Republicans alike quickly called for additional spending, and the Biden administration found reason for it. The roughly $10 billion request transmitted to Congress would help train Ukraine’s military, boost its cybersecurity defenses, provide food and other humanitarian aid, and fortify its electricity supply.

It also called for funding to enforce the president’s recent actions to punish Russia. That includes $59 million for a task force, announced during the president’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, that aims to enforce sanctions against Russian oligarchs who have avoided them. And it proposed $91 million for the Treasury Department, an allotment that would support the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which can pursue offshore companies and trusts often hidden from government view.

The Biden administration’s request for aid to combat the coronavirus comes about a month after top officials told lawmakers that they had exhausted nearly all the money set aside for the Department of Health and Human Services to respond to the pandemic.

Initially, HHS asked Congress for more than $30 billion to bolster public health programs, with a focus on stocking the country with more therapeutics and monoclonal antibodies and researching new vaccines. The Biden administration sought an additional $5 billion to aid the deployment of vaccines globally, hoping to help prevent more dangerous versions of the virus from originating in unprotected populations.

Ultimately, though, the administration settled on a formal request for $22.5 billion — with about $18.25 billion set aside for public health and $4.25 billion for global vaccine deployment. The latter figure amounts to less than some congressional Democrats initially sought, although party lawmakers have labored in recent days to try to increase the sum.

Even before the Biden administration transmitted the request, it had encountered early political obstacles, as spending-wary Republicans questioned whether the money is needed. Nearly a year after the party opposed Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid package, some including McConnell have urged the administration to repurpose existing aid rather than seek new funds. This week, three dozen GOP members also criticized the White House, saying it had failed to be transparent about how much has been spent and how much remains of the roughly $6 trillion in emergency funds approved since the start of the pandemic.

“We want to know where the money has gone,” said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who led a letter Wednesday to the Biden administration signaling the GOP may not support additional aid. The missive raised the possibility that Republicans could withhold their votes unless they first receive more information about the administration’s existing spending.

Taking to the Senate floor a day later, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded to the concerns with a warning. “Either we act now to secure the progress we made, or we risk backsliding,” he said.

4,e358873f-6c9a-4b1f-b8f7-731b22df74d2,['Joe Gould'],2022-03-03 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON ― The White House has formally asked Congress for $32.5 billion in pandemic relief and “critical assistance” to help Ukraine fight off a Russian invasion, with $4.8 billion for the Pentagon, as part of an updated supplemental spending request.

Ukraine spending makes up $10 billion, split between the Pentagon ― for troop deployments in Eastern Europe, covert support and to replace U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine ― and the State Department, for humanitarian, economic and military aid. The request unveiled Thursday marks a big jump from the Biden administration’s stated need of $6.4 billion for Ukraine aid days ago.

Acting White House budget director Shalanda Young outlined the new request in a March 2 letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

“This request identifies an immediate need for $10.0 billion in additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance for Ukraine and Central European partners due to Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion,” Young said in the letter, adding that she foresees additional needs over time.

Young also urged Congress to pass full-year appropriations bills for fiscal 2022, already five months overdue and needed to prevent a federal government shutdown by March 11. She echoed Pentagon leaders who have said the chaos of multiple stopgap spending bills hurts their planning and budgeting.

“The absence of full-year appropriations would continue to constrain Department of Defense (DOD) resources, readiness, and operations around the globe,” she said. “The impact on readiness and operations would constrain priority efforts in Europe and also leave the U.S. more vulnerable to other potential adversaries exploiting the global situation.”

The Ukraine part of the request breaks down as follows:

$1.8 billion to cover troop deployments in support of U.S. European Command and NATO Response Forces, including funding transportation of personnel and equipment, temporary duty, special pay, flying hours, airlift, weapons system sustainment, medical support and other unit support costs.

$1.25 billion for cybersecurity, intelligence and classified programs. “This funding supports operational surges across multiple national defense components” and includes “weapons system upgrades.”

$1.35 billion to replenish stocks of U.S. military weapons for Ukraine, military education and training, and “immediate military assistance to Ukraine.”

$5 billion for State Department humanitarian and economic aid efforts, with $500 million in foreign military financing to support Ukraine and “top security requirements” of Eastern European NATO allies.

$1.2 billion in presidential authority to draw further from U.S. military stocks with some broader authorities. To provide excess defense equipment, the White House wants a waiver of the requirement it notify Congress within 30-days and monetary limits as well as the authority to reprogram funds from fiscal 2022 and prior years for Ukraine.

$200 million across the Commerce, Energy, Justice and Treasury departments for other efforts to target Russia and support Ukraine, including sanctions enforcement, Russia and U.S. supply chain analysis.

Some lawmakers have urged the Biden administration, which has already committed $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, to move swiftly and with more resources to keep Ukrainian forces supplied. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is taking a darker turn, marked by fresh assaults on residential areas and and a refugee exodus that just hit 1 million people.

“Just briefed that 100% of the Defense Dept portion of the $6.4B aid package the Biden admin is requesting from Congress is to pay for the U.S. troops deploying to Europe and to replenish U.S. war stocks NOT new lethal aide for Ukraine,” Florida Rep. Michael Waltz, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee’s readiness subpanel, tweeted Wednesday. “[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky needs more ammo NOW!”

The U.S. has delivered hundreds of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine for the first time over the last few days, including over 200 on Monday, NBC News was first to report.

The $22.5 billion in COVID relief funding is a partisan sticking point. U.S. President Joe Biden said it’s needed to prepare for future variants, while three dozen Republican senators sent a letter to the White House questioning it.

Another dispute is that some Republicans have called for Ukraine aid to be considered separately from an annual appropriations package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the FY22 spending package is the “quickest and most efficient way to” approve the aid.

“Nothing would make Putin happier than having Democrats and Republicans divided,” Schumer said Tuesday.

Whether Congress can move quickly will be a test of its resolve to address the Ukraine crisis, said the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Bradley Bowman, a former advisor to members of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees.

“For members of Congress who’ve been critical of Biden’s slow response on Ukraine, now is an opportunity to walk the talk,” Bowman said in a tweet Thursday. “Let’s see how fast Congress can move.”

The request follows weeks of discussions between White House officials and lawmakers about the shape of any potential emergency request, which was expected to focus heavily on Covid-19 needs. But the escalating Russian invasion has dramatically increased the size of the specific request for Ukraine.

Lawmakers are in the midst of negotiations over a long-term funding deal and face a March 11 deadline to reach an agreement.

The Ukraine funds are expected to be attached to any final deal, but the process remains fluid.

The White House stressed that the request is meant to address the immediate, short-term needs related to the crisis in Europe caused by Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began last week.

“Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, I anticipate that additional needs may arise over time,” White House Office of Management and Budget acting Director Shalanda Young wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dated March 2 outlining the request.

“This funding request is based on the Administration’s best information on resource requirements at this time, and we will remain in touch with the Congress in the coming weeks and months as we assess resource requirements beyond these immediate needs,” she wrote.

Young asked that the funding be authorized as part of an appropriations bill that Congress is expected to approve before a March 11 deadline to fund the government.

Democrats and Republicans have signaled support for additional assistance for Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion. As of Friday, the White House was eyeing $6.4 billion in additional funding for Ukraine, but that figure increased this week.

The letter breaks down the funding request. It asks for $4.8 billion for the Pentagon to support U.S. troop deployments to NATO countries and to provide additional military equipment to Ukraine.

The Biden administration is asking for $5 billion for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for security, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and allies on NATO’s eastern flank. Of that funding, $2.75 billion would go towards humanitarian assistance to provide food and support for Ukrainians displaced by the conflict.

The United Nations refugee agency said late Wednesday that 1 million refugees have fled from Ukraine since Russia launched a broad invasion of Ukraine one week ago.

Additionally, the White House is also asking for $21 million in additional funding for the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security to increase enforcement of export control restrictions imposed on Russia and analyze Russian economic vulnerabilities and any U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities.

The request also includes $59 million for a new Justice Department task force to enforce sanctions on Russian oligarchs and $91 million for the Treasury Department to bolster the agency’s work on the sanctions.

Finally, $30 million would go to the Energy Department to support the integration of Ukraine’s electric grid with the European Union’s own network.

“These resources will mean additional military equipment for Ukraine, lifesaving humanitarian assistance — such as emergency food assistance — for the Ukrainian people, stronger sanctions enforcement, a dedicated task force within the Department of Justice to go after the ill-gotten gains and other illicit activities of the Russian oligarchs, and additional support for U.S troop deployments to neighboring countries,” Young wrote in a blog post on Thursday.

“Resources will also bolster regional efforts to counter Russian cyberattacks and disinformation, and strengthen the stability of Ukraine’s electrical grid by integrating it with the European Network of Transmission System of Operators,” she wrote.

The White House supplemental funding request also includes an additional $22.5 billion to address the COVID-19 pandemic, an ask that will be a tougher sell among Republicans who have resisted new funding to support the government’s virus response.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled a $32.5 billion emergency plan to help Ukraine respond to Russia's military invasion and provide more money to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking a new partisan battle in Congress amid a March 11 deadline for settling budget matters.

There appeared to be strong, bipartisan support in the Democratic-controlled Congress for $10 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine following the Feb. 24 launch of Russia's invasion into its territory.

But some Republicans and a couple of centrist Democrats questioned the $22.5 billion in additional coronavirus pandemic aid on the heels of last year's $1.9 trillion ""American Rescue Plan"" that passed with only Democratic support.

The White House and congressional Democrats want to bundle the Ukraine and COVID-19 emergency funds with a much larger third package of around $1.5 trillion to keep regular government operations running beyond March 11, when stopgap funds expire.

Without action by Congress, many federal agencies would have to pare or shut down operations at the end of next week.

Republicans argued some of the American Rescue Plan money is unspent and should be used before a new tranche is considered.

""We shouldn't give money where it's not needed, because we're borrowing it,"" Senator Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told Reuters.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, however, signaled support for COVID-19 funding, saying ""multiple crises are hitting at the same time.""

Some lawmakers fretted that the budget dispute, if unresolved, could have far-reaching fallout - showcasing political divisions in the United States that could hearten Russian President Vladimir Putin, delaying military aid to Ukraine and flirting with a U.S. government shutdown.

Democratic Senator Dick Durbin downplayed such concerns, saying coupling the Ukraine money with other spending could speed budget negotiations.

""I think it could be a spark to get it (Ukraine money) moving quickly,"" Durbin told reporters.

A House Democratic aide said closed-door negotiations on the entire appropriations package were making progress, although disagreements still had to be ironed out. Negotiators hoped to unveil a massive bill in coming days so it can quickly move through the House and Senate and be sent to President Joe Biden for signing into law by the March 11 deadline.

The White House and congressional Democrats argued that funding of key portions of the American Rescue Plan was nearly exhausted for facilitating the manufacture and shipping of more vaccines and COVID-19 tests needed to battle future spikes in the deadly disease.

""We are therefore urging Congress to promptly provide $22.5 billion to cover immediate needs for tests, treatments and vaccines, investments in research and development of next-generation vaccines, and responding globally, including getting more shots in arms around the world,"" Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young said in a statement.

More than 90% of American Rescue Plan funds have been committed, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Additional COVID-19 resources would allow the government to secure treatments, vaccines and tests for the coming months and fight future variants, Young said. The money would also ensure the continuation of free community testing, treatment and vaccination coverage for uninsured individuals.
