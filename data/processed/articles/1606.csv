History

History of Russian & Ukraine 1

Why Ukraine once the third-largest nuclear power gave up its nuclear weapons. 1

History lesson (from a Romanian analyst) 1

The role of paratroopers in Russian military doctrine 1

Since WWII there were only three cases when Russian paratroopers were actually dropped on the enemy from the air: Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, Ukraine 2022. Ergo, paratroopers act as paratroopers only when they don't expect resistance from another regular army

Paratroopers were supposed to take control of the main cities and logistical clusters, so the occupation of the country by the army would go smoothly. But Ukrainian army opened fire and they failed. And after that initial failure the entire plan was broken

Putin's Blitzkrieg failed because it wasn't a Blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg is a war operation against an enemy who fights. But Russia launched a special operation expecting Ukrainians to surrender. That's why they sent forward their glorified riot police. Of course, they were beaten TLDR: They're used more as ""riot police"" for intimidation/psyop than spec ops

Civilian Resistor Advice

Urban warfare tips from a former Marine 1

Stay out of the street. Stay out of street. For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside. Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills. Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives. The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible. When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last. Don’t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you. Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it’s much more handy than a rifle. Never fire from the same window twice. Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don’t expose it. Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from. If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you. Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him. Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive. Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long. One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area. Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible. Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment. It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them. have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window. After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were. Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have. 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people. Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force. Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible. if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position. if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source. Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long.

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1503436420886712321.html

CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarity with #HermeticWiper, #IsaacWiper or any other malware known to us. The sample we analyzed was not digitally signed.

Similarly to HermeticWiper deployments, we observed CaddyWiper being deployed via GPO, indicating the attackers had prior control of the target's network beforehand.

Confirmed: A significant disruption has been registered on multiple networks supplied by #Israel's leading providers Bezeq and Cellcom as the country's defense authorities and National Cyber Directorate declare a state of emergency 1

Putin considers the retreat in #UkraineRussiaWar as his death sentence. 1

Just off the phone with an officer from Ukraine's military intelligence service (GUR). Someone I've known now for four years who's often rolled his eyes at official Ukrainian government pronouncements. A few observations/comments: 1

He also confirmed the majority of Ukraine's Air Force is still in tact, on Day 12, including fixed wing and rotary aircraft. I asked how many operational Bayraktar TB2 drones Ukraine has in its arsenal. He laughed. ""OK, Michael, can I just say: 'It's enough.'""

Zelensky: ""While Russians are to blame for the killings, responsibility is shared by those who for 13 days in their Western offices haven’t been able to approve an obviously necessary decision, who didn’t save our cities from these bombs and missiles – although they can."" 1

1/14 Whether Russians actually support the hideous war that Putin has waged against Ukraine is a matter of utmost political importance. The answer to this question will largely define Russia’s place in the history of the 21st century. 1

Throughout the history of ACF’s polling department, we have never observed such dynamics of public opinion shifts. It took a few days of war to bring about radical mood changes among Russians.

The international hacker group Anonymous hacked the website of the Russian Federal Security Service. 1

Russian hackers keep on attacking Ukrainian information resources nonstop. Since the beginning of invasion, DDos attacks have been primarily aimed at the resources of Verkhovna Rada, Cabinet of Ministers, President of Ukraine, Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry 1

The most powerful attacks exceeded 100 Gbps at their peak. Despite all the involved enemy’s resources, the sites of the central governmental bodies are available. The only thing the occupants managed to do was to substitute the front pages at the sites of some local authorities. 1

Got off the strangest call just now. Company called me for advice for dealing with ""the cyber war"" A few min into the call I realized there were differing opinions of some of the people on the call. I'm sharing an anonymized version. There's LOTS to unpack. 1

A verified image first acquired by @bellingcat shows the attack included Russian-manufactured 300mm Smerch rockets with 9N235 cluster munitions. The 2019 manufacture date, after Russia stopped selling these arms to Ukraine, indicates that the attack was launched by Russia. 1 2

Zelensky to Putin: Get off our land ""If you don't want to leave now - sit down with me at the negotiating table, I'm free. But not by 30 meters, like with Macron, Scholz - I'm a neighbor! I don't bite. I'm a normal man, sit down with me, talk to me, what are you afraid of?"" 1

Ukrainian emergency services say fire at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in a training building outside the main perimeter 1

I've studied nuclear power quite a bit, and I'm going to say shooting rockets at a large nuclear power plant is a really bad idea. 1 They need to stop this immediately and allow emergency services/inspectors to get in there We definitely need more details. Things could end up okay. Things could end up pretty bad. I'm just saying... don't. fire. rockets. at. nuclear. power. plants. Lots of people are bringing up Chernobyl. It's a different, safer kind of reactor. However, a meltdown would still not be good at all.

Nuclear physicist here: there's a lot to be worried about, but one thing you SHOULDN'T worry about, is Russia bombing Ukrainian nuclear power plants. It's literally, physically impossible to make those explode. 1 Some clarification: when I say ""can't explode"", I mean that it can't explode like a nuke (because no reactor can do that), and can't explode like Chernobyl (because it's a different technology, inherently safer - and the safety is in the physics itself, can't be switched off).

Biden spoke with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine about the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant fire. POTUS urged Russia to cease hostilities and “allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site.” 1

LockBit Ransomware Group confirms they are apolitical (not making the same mistake as Conti) 1

Russia is intentionally re-routing and sniffing massive amounts of internet traffic from Ukraine. Calls, sms, possible geolocations: probably used for military targeting. It’s called: BGP Hijacking 1

As rapporteur on Europe’s new cyber security legislation NIS2, I’ve put forward an amendment to demand every EU member state to introduce safe routing protocols (RPKI for example) so that these BGP Hijacks are no longer possible. Now everyone understands why

The Kremlin’s propaganda machine is running at full throttle 1

Russia is not conducting a war, Mr Putin’s flacks insist, but a nearly bloodless military operation to free its Ukrainian brothers from the vile West and its Nazi proxies in Ukraine.

Unprepared for the scale of the war or its consequences, many Russians, especially middle-class and educated ones, are horrified. Despite the risk of being arrested or beaten with truncheons, anti-war protesters have massed and marched in several Russian cities. In the past five days, about 4,000 people have been detained, though most are swiftly released. Anonymous, an international hacking group, has joined the fray. It has launched denial-of-service attacks on Russian state media and posted a message on many of them: “Dear citizens. We call on you to stop this madness. Don’t send your sons and husbands to die. It is time to act–come out on the streets!”
