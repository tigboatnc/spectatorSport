Ukraine: 18 journalists killed in country since Russian invasion KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian government says that 18 journalists have been killed in the country since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24. The Ukrainian Culture and Information Ministry said in a statement on social media Monday that each of the deaths and other crimes against media representatives will be investigated. The ministry added that another 13 journalists had been wounded, eight had been abducted or taken prisoner and three journalists were still missing. It said that several crimes had been committed against journalists from 11 countries, including Ukraine. Share this -







Ukrainian Foreign Minister: No place for Russia on the U.N. Human Rights Council Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he has spoken with the head of the United Nations and pledged that Ukraine will do all it can to hold Russia accountable for war crimes. Kuleba tweeted that he spoke to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres about what he called a massacre in the Kyiv-area city of Bucha. “Stressed that Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account,” Kuleba wrote. “No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council.” Photos have shown what appeared to be the bodies of civilians in the street in Bucha after Russian forces left. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general has said that the bodies of 410 killed civilians have been removed from the Kyiv region. Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians. Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said more than 300 people were killed. Russia’s Defense Ministry has denied the claims. Human Rights Watch also said Sunday that its investigators had documented “summary executions” and “other grave abuses” in several regions Russia controlled in Ukraine, including around Kyiv.

Zelenskyy to address U.N. Security Council Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will address the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, a day after he visited a town where authorities said they found hundreds of dead civilians. Speaking in a nightly address, Zelenskyy again called on democratically elected leaders to supply the country with more weapons and to impose “strong” sanctions on Russia “for the mass murders of civilians.” “Ukraine needs to get all the needed weapons in order to repulse the occupiers faster from our land,” he said. “To free our cities. And if we already had what we needed, all the planes, tanks, artillery, rocket defense systems, we could have saved thousands of people. I am not blaming you. I am only blaming the Russian soldiers. But you could help.” Earlier, Zelenksyy visited Bucha, one of the Kyiv-area towns where Ukrainian officials have said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found. Associated Press reporters who visited the city said some appeared to have been killed at close range; at least two had their hands tied behind their backs, and one had been shot in the head. Zelenskyy said there may be even more casualties in the nearby town of Borodyanka. Russia, which has veto power on the key 15-member U.N. Security Council, has denied targeting civilians, and its Defense Ministry has accused Ukrainian officials of staging the deaths in Bucha for Western media. Share this -







Death toll in another town outside Kyiv could top Bucha's, Zelenskyy says The number of fatally wounded victims in a town outside Kyiv could surpass the death toll in Bucha, where Ukrainian authorities have said they found hundreds of civilians’ bodies after Russian forces retreated, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday. Zelenskyy said officials have “information” showing potentially high fatality counts in Borodyanka, about 15 miles west of Bucha, and other towns that are no longer under Russian control. NBC News has not independently verified the claim, nor has it confirmed the 410 deaths that Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said have been discovered in and around Bucha. After visiting Bucha and two other cities in the region, Zelenskyy said many bodies had been recovered in areas with bullet-riddled cars and torched military equipment. “It is especially hard to see the bullet holes on the cars that have ‘children’ written on them,” he said. A Maxar satellite image shows destroyed homes and vehicles Thursday along Vokzalna Street in Bucha, Ukraine. Satellite image (C)2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite images released Monday by a U.S. defense contractor, Maxar, showed what the company said were sections of Bucha that had been devastated by Russian bombardment. Blackened streets and charred vehicles could be seen next to houses that appeared to have been leveled. Zelenskyy said “all the crimes of the occupiers are being documented” for a war crimes investigation that he said would be “full and transparent.” “The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who killed their fellow citizens,” he said. “Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this and make it globally known. It is now 2022. And we have many more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II.” Russian authorities have denied targeting civilians. In a statement, the country’s Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian authorities of having “stage managed” the casualties in Bucha “for the Western media.” Share this -







Drug shortages persist in Russia after start of Ukraine war First came the warnings, in messages among friends and families and on social media, to stock up on vital drugs in Russia before supplies were affected by crippling Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Then, some drugs indeed became harder to find at pharmacies in Moscow and other cities. Experts and health authorities in Russia say the drug shortages are temporary — due to panic- buying and logistical difficulties for suppliers from the sanctions — but some remain worried that high-quality medicines will keep disappearing in the Russian market. “Most likely there will be shortages. How catastrophic it will be, I don’t know,” said Dr. Alexey Erlikh, head of the cardiac intensive care unit in Moscow Hospital No. 29, and a professor at the Moscow-based Pirogov Medical University. Experts say panic-buying has played a role in creating drug shortages. “People rushed to stock up, and in some cases, supplies that were supposed to last a year or a year and a half were bought out within a month,” Nikolay Bespalov, development director of the RNC Pharma analytical company, told AP. Bespalov also pointed to logistical problems that occurred early in the crisis. While major Western pharmaceutical companies pledged not to withdraw vital medications from the Russian market, sanctions cut Russia’s key banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, hindering international payments. Dozens of countries halted air traffic with Russia, disrupting supply chains. The expert stressed the logistical issues have been largely resolved, but panic-buying, prompted by fears that foreign companies will halt supplies, may continue fueling shortages for some time.

Ukraine says 15 evacuation buses left Zaporizhia for Mariupol Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram message Monday that 15 buses have left Zaporizhia for Mariupol. Mariupol has seen numerous delays in humanitarian aid and transportation for those evacuating the city over the past several weeks. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of blocking supplies and harming those trying to leave, which NBC News has not independently verified. Vereshchuk said 3,376 citizens have been evacuated via humanitarian corridors as officials continue to evacuate people from several other cities in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine.

France to expel Russian diplomats The French Foreign Ministry announced Monday that multiple Russian diplomats would be expelled from the country. The move was described as part of a wider European approach, and the ministry said the diplomats' presence is ""contrary to our security interests."" Earlier in the day, Germany declared that several members of the Russian Embassy were unwelcome in the country. Share this -







Germany says some members of Russian Embassy no longer welcome The German government on Monday declared several members of the Russian Embassy as unwelcome in its country. “Their work is a threat to those who seek shelter with us. We will no longer tolerate this,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement. Government officials said they reported the declaration to the Russian ambassador Monday afternoon. “We will further tighten the existing sanctions against Russia, we will resolutely increase our support for the Ukrainian armed forces, and we will also strengthen NATO’s eastern flank,” Baerbock said.

Number of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine declining, senior U.S. official says The number of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine has declined in recent days, and the Russians have “reprioritized” their air activity, a senior defense official said. The Russian forces have refocused on Ukrainian positions in the south and around Izyum, near Kharkiv in the eastern portion of Ukraine, the official said, and the level of airstrikes on Kyiv has fallen in recent days. Russian troops around Izyum have been moving south and southeast toward the Donbas region, where they are repositioning and reinforcing their artillery. Share this -







Two-thirds of Russian troops around Kyiv have left, senior U.S. official says About two-thirds of the Russian troops that were positioned around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv have now left and are headed to Belarus, according to a senior defense official. The troops are heading north and consolidating in Belarus, the official said. The U.S. believes they are being refitted, resupplied and perhaps reinforced with additional manpower, and then will be sent back into Ukraine to continue fighting elsewhere. The U.S. thinks they may go to the Donbas region. “That doesn’t mean Kyiv is not under threat,” said the official. “And it doesn’t mean the Russians can’t change course or that there isn’t still a ground threat against Kyiv. Nobody is spiking any footballs here.” Share this -







U.K. calls for Russia to be suspended from U.N. Human Rights Council The United Kingdom's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday called for Russia to be suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council. Her demand came after reports of attacks on civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha outside Kyiv. ""Given strong evidence of war crimes, including reports of mass graves and heinous butchery in Bucha, Russia cannot remain a member of the UN Human Rights Council,"" Truss tweeted.

Biden administration is considering new sanctions on Russia, official says The Biden administration is considering adding more sanctions on Russia and tightening existing ones in response to actions by Russian troops in Bucha, according to a senior administration official. Speaking to reporters Monday morning, President Joe Biden confirmed that he will announce more sanctions, but did not give a timeline. The possible shift comes after reports of civilian massacres and mass graves in Bucha circulated, prompting international condemnation and claims that the attacks were war crimes. While it is unclear which retaliatory measures the administration is considering, The Washington Post reported that the Biden administration has previously discussed “secondary sanctions” on countries that continue to trade with Russia, as well as other measures targeting their economy not seen in previous rounds of sanctions.

More than 20 schools attacked in Ukraine per day, U.K. aid group says About 22 schools have been attacked in Ukraine per day since the war began five weeks ago, according to a news release Monday from the U.K. humanitarian organization Save the Children. The group said that ongoing military operations have disrupted the education of around 5.5 million children who remain in the country. More than 2 million children have fled, it noted. About 869 education facilities have been damaged — about 6 percent of schools in the country — and 83 destroyed, the Ukrainian ministry of education and science has said. Of those attacks, 43 percent have taken place in eastern Ukraine, where the organization said more than 400,000 children lived prior to Feb. 24. Peter Walsh, Save the Children's country director in Ukraine, called for those involved in the conflict to ""protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education staff,"" as well as avoid using educational facilities for military purposes. ""Schools should be safe places of learning for children and must be free from attacks at all times,"" he said. The organization noted that the war has ""exacerbated an already challenging educational context"" in Ukraine. Prior to the conflict, the group said 30 percent of education facilities in eastern Ukraine reported not having enough teachers, a problem that is worsening as many flee the country.

Zelenskyy says peace talks 'difficult' after Bucha devastation Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy says peace talks with Russia will be more difficult after Russia's military carried out what he called war crimes in Bucha in recent days. Speaking from the Kyiv suburb Monday, Zelenskyy said he wanted the world to see ""what the Russian military was doing"" amid claims from Ukrainian officials that hundreds of civilians were killed by Russian forces there. “This is a war crime and it will be recognized by the world as genocide,"" he said of Russia's attacks on Ukraine. Noting peace talks that recently took place in Istanbul, he said: ""it is very difficult to negotiate when you see what they have done here."" Still, he said that the longer peace talks are delayed ""the worse it is for (Russia), and in principle for this situation, this war, because every day our troops come in and de-occupy the territories.""

Putin imposes visa restrictions on citizens from 'unfriendly' countries Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Monday introducing visa restrictions for citizens of countries that Moscow deems “unfriendly” in response to sanctions over Ukraine. The decree, which comes into force Monday, suspends Russia’s simplified visa issuance regime with some European Union countries, as well as Norway, Switzerland, Denmark and Iceland. It also ordered the Russian foreign ministry and other bodies to decide on introducing personal entry restrictions on “foreign citizens and stateless people who commit unfriendly actions against Russia, its citizens or its legal entities.” It comes after the Russian government last month approved a list of unfriendly countries including the United States, Canada, Britain, E.U. states and Ukraine, among others.

Russia’s chief investigator orders inquiry into Ukraine's Bucha claims Russia’s chief investigator ordered an official probe into Ukraine’s accusations of Russian forces killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a statement Monday, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it was looking into Ukraine’s claims, as well as images shared by Ukrainian officials that it said aimed to “discredit the Russian military personnel.” Russia has rejected the claim that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, despite photos and video appearing to show bodies on city streets as its troops pulled out of Bucha and other cities near Kyiv. It has branded Ukraine’s claims a “provocation.” NBC News has not been able to independently verify the photos.

Schuetze']",2022-04-04 00:00:00,"A photograph released by Russian state media shows President Vladimir V. Putin meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov at the Kremlin on Monday.

The images of dead Ukrainians, some with their hands tied and others haphazardly buried in pits, spurred shocked Western leaders on Monday to promise even tougher sanctions against Russia, including possibly on energy, as the Kremlin dug in and showed signs of preparing a new assault.

The growing evidence that Russian soldiers killed scores of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, leaving their bodies behind as they withdrew, prompted President Biden to call for President Vladimir V. Putin to face a “war crime trial.” Germany and France expelled a total of 75 Russian diplomats, and President Emmanuel Macron of France said the European Union should consider sanctions against Russian coal and oil.

“This guy is brutal,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Putin. “And what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it.”

In Moscow on Monday, Mr. Putin said nothing about his war in Ukraine, but his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the Kremlin “categorically” denied “any allegations” of Russian involvement in the atrocities. Instead, Russia’s state media aired relentless conspiracy theories about what it said was a Ukrainian fabrication, while the authorities threatened to prosecute anyone who publicly blamed Russians for the Bucha killings.

Russia said the bodies had been placed only recently on the streets after “all Russian units withdrew completely from Bucha” around March 30. But a review of videos and satellite imagery by The New York Times shows that many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia’s military was in control of the town.

The war in Ukraine may now be headed for an even more dangerous phase, despite Russia’s withdrawal last week from areas near Kyiv.

Ukrainian and Western officials said that Russia appeared to be positioning troops for an intensified assault in the eastern Donbas area, where the port city of Mariupol remains under a brutal siege. And in Kharkiv, roughly 30 miles from the Russian border, unrelenting bombardment has left parts of the city of 1.4 million unrecognizable.

The systematic destruction produces little military gain, but is part of a broader strategy to seize the country’s east, analysts and U.S. military officials say.

With the Russian economy showing some signs of resilience after the initial shock of the wide-ranging Western sanctions put in place after Mr. Putin’s invasion in February, the Kremlin appeared to be girding for a continuation of the war, despite talk in European capitals of now possibly banning Russian coal, oil or, less likely, gas.

“They are not going to stop,” Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said in a statement on Monday. “Putin’s order given to his soldiers to destroy our state has not disappeared.”

In a visit to Bucha on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine left the door open to a negotiated peace, despite the horrific scenes uncovered over the weekend. In a camouflage bulletproof vest, surrounded by soldiers and journalists, Mr. Zelensky accused Russia of “genocide,” but said he was still hoping to meet with Mr. Putin to try to stop the war.

“Ukraine must have peace,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We are in Europe in the 21st century. We will continue efforts diplomatically and militarily.”

Mr. Biden, speaking to reporters in Washington after returning from Delaware, said that “information” needed to be gathered for a trial of Mr. Putin, calling the Russian leader a “war criminal.” Mr. Biden said he would at some point be announcing more sanctions against Russia, without specifying what they would be.

In Europe, the growing evidence of Russian atrocities also appeared to be paving the way for more sanctions, even as divisions remained among E.U. members of whether to impose a broad ban on Russian energy imports.

“Today there are very clear signs of war crimes,” Mr. Macron, the French president, told France Inter radio. “Those who were responsible for those crimes will have to answer for them.”

European Union ambassadors will meet on Wednesday to discuss another package of sanctions against Russia, but the extent of the new measures is still very much in flux, diplomats and officials said. A meeting of NATO defense ministers is also scheduled to take place that day.

Since the start of the conflict, European leaders, along with the United States, have pursued a strategy of putting sanctions in place a piece at a time, gradually toughening them to leave themselves more cards to play in case Russia escalates the conflict.

But the outrage over the new revelations of atrocities may force their hand.

One version of a new E.U. sanctions package under consideration could include a ban on Russian coal, but not oil and gas, E.U. officials said. Bans on Russian goods entering E.U. ports are also under consideration, as well as smaller measures to close loopholes in existing sanctions, European diplomats and officials said.

While Mr. Macron said the new sanctions should target both coal and oil, Christian Lindner, the German finance minister, indicated that coal would be the only Russian energy export included in the sanctions package. The European Union, he said, needed to “differentiate between oil, coal and gas.”

Coal, which is largely mined by private companies in Russia, is less critical to the Kremlin’s coffers than the oil and gas industry, in which state-owned companies play the leading role.

Germany is the key country holding the bloc back from an outright ban on oil and gas, though the idea is also unpopular in other, smaller European nations that largely rely on Russian supplies. Berlin has consistently argued that sanctions against Russia ought to hurt Russia more than they hurt Europe.

Germany’s hesitation to endorse oil and gas sanctions was on display Sunday, when cracks appeared in the coalition government’s position on such a move.

Christine Lambrecht, the defense minister, said the bloc should consider banning gas imports, while the economy and energy minister, Robert Habeck said such a move would not be useful because Mr. Putin has “already practically lost the war.”

“The horrifying news from Bucha will certainly pile more pressure on the E.U. to impose energy sanctions on Moscow this Wednesday, but hard-hitting import bans on oil and gas remain unlikely for now,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.

“Internal momentum is building over stopping Russian coal,” Mr. Rahman said, “If anything, that’s likely to be the first thing Brussels targets on the energy side.”

Mr. Rahman said that, for now, the economic and political costs of a sudden stop of Russian oil and gas imports were too high for most E.U. leaders. He said it could take Russia using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine to lead the E.U. to impose sanctions on oil and gas imports.

Still, the Bucha revelations did prompt Germany and France — two countries that have long been careful to avoid provoking Russia — to escalate the confrontation with Moscow.

Germany said it would expel 40 Russian diplomats, an unusually high number for a single round of expulsions that Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said was necessitated by the “incredible brutality on the part of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda.”

France said it, too, would expel “many” Russian diplomats stationed in the country; a Foreign Ministry official put the number at 35.

And Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and recalled its own from Moscow, the first time that a European country has made such a move since the start of the war.

Russia promised to retaliate against the expulsions and dismissed the reports of the atrocities in Bucha, describing them as fabricated pretexts for more sanctions. State television even claimed that Western operatives had chosen Bucha for their “provocation” because the town’s name sounded like the English word “butcher.”

It was the latest instance in which the Kremlin’s media machine has tried to parry overwhelming evidence of Russian involvement in an atrocity with a flood of conspiracy theories sowing confusion among casual consumers of the news.

It appeared likely that, inside Russia, the approach would work. The Kremlin narrative is increasingly the only one being heard by regular Russians, with independent news media shut down, access to Facebook and Instagram blocked, and a new censorship law punishing any deviation from that narrative with as much as 15 years in prison.

Driving the point home, the Russian general prosecutor’s office issued a statement on Monday indicating that anyone referring to the Bucha atrocities as Russia’s doing risked prosecution.

Russia has denied any involvement in civilian deaths in the town of Bucha, insisting that photographs showing the bodies were ""fakes"" concocted by Ukraine. But several probes are debunking some of these claims.

One claim centred on footage taken from a car as it drove through the town showing what appeared to be dead bodies on either side of the road.

Pro-Russian social media accounts then circulated a slowed-down version of the video, claiming that the arm on one of the bodies moved and were not lifeless.

But the BBC's Reality Check and Monitoring teams have since verified multiple images of the same scene separately captured by news agency AFP, clearly showing a dead body in the same position and place as the video.

Meanwhile, satellite images analysed by the New York Times appear to confirm that many civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russian forces were in control of Bucha.

The newspaper says a before-and-after analysis of the imagery shows objects of a similar size to a human body between 9 and 11 March in the precise positions where bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed the town last week.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60991746/page/12
