One is above ground, an area containing row after row of broken buildings and charred cars on roads cratered by bombs, solitary figures hurrying along, and frightened faces peering out of windows amid the sound of explosions.

There is another Saltivka, though, comprising hundreds of people who used to live there and are now transplanted underground, huddled together in metro stations, anxious about whether the homes they left behind have survived the daily barrage of missile strikes and artillery rounds.

Saltivka is the most heavily bombed district of one of the most extensively bombed cities in the war so far, Kharkiv.

Ukraine’s second city has yet to experience the withdrawal of Russian forces, as has happened around the capital, Kyiv. Here the onslaught has continued as the Kremlin attempts to block off the Donbas, which lies to the east of the city.

Ukrainian troops have made hard-fought gains in the villages and towns around Kharkiv, but Vladimir Putin’s forces remain within close enough range to carry out salvos of lethal strikes, often indiscriminately, into residential areas, taking a rising toll of lives.

Residents in some parts of Saltivka are among the most economically deprived in Kharkiv, often either unemployed or without regular work. Many of them do not have the identification documents necessary to receive government emergency support, let alone passports to get out of the country to escape the war.

Oleksandr Pavluyk has been going through abandoned homes on a run-down estate to try to find left-behind food for his elderly mother and himself. He shows what he has managed to find after an hour and a half of foraging – two loaves of stale, crumbling bread, two onions, four potatoes, three mouldy apples, and a can of salmon.

“Most people who live here did not have a lot anyway, so I wasn’t expecting much,” he tells The Independent. “We haven’t had electricity for days, so food in the fridges has rotted. But the salmon is good, my mother would like that, it would be a luxury. It would be nice to give her something good at a time like this. I’ve stayed out here because of her – she does not want to leave – but life is hard for her, for us.”

Mr Pavluyk says he tried to persuade his 73-year-old mother, Yulia, that they should go somewhere safer, stressing that it was far too dangerous to stay on, but failed to change her mind.

There are sounds of blasts as the 42-year-old building worker, who had not worked for five months even before the war started, describes their desperate predicament.

“Maybe they are trying to hit a [Ukrainian] army post which was there. That moved a while ago, but they still keep bombing this area. We have also had these buildings hit directly, and these are just people’s homes”, he says, pointing at blasted walls, balconies sheared off and shattered windows.

“This happens a lot, I don’t know why. Most people have gone away. There aren’t many left to kill here.”

Kharkiv is only 25 miles from Russia, and this stretch of Saltivka is one of the points closest to the border. “It is not far for them to bomb,” says Denis Zhuravlov, standing outside another apartment block. “We have not seen any real reduction of the attacks since these peace talks started. They stop for a few hours and then start again.”

Mr Zhuravlov wants to talk about the “new types” of bombs being used by the Russians.

“They burst in the air, and then float down and burst again at low level,” he says, pointing towards pieces of orange cloth hanging from branches. “They have been using all kinds of weapons here. People are frightened to be out; that is why they went from here. Our neighbours went to stay at the train stations, a lot of people have from here.”

The move to seek shelter at the metro stations began on the first day of the invasion, 24 February. Hostilities began in Kharkiv with sustained missile attacks. Oksana Kovaleva’s apartment block was hit within 45 minutes of the first attack. She grabbed her four-year-old daughter Iryna and her son, Yuri, threw on a coat, and rushed out of the building.

Another family was fleeing by car and stopped to take Ms Kovaleva and her children to one of the nearest metro stations, where the vehicle was abandoned and they all rushed underground.

“Soon there were more and more people coming in. Everyone was terrified – the explosions were so loud that we could even hear them underground,” she says. “I was not thinking about our apartment at the time. We were just very grateful that we were alive, my kids were all right. It was relief more than anything else.”

Ms Kovaleva’s husband, Anton, had joined a volunteer battalion of the Ukrainian forces, which had deployed to the front line east of the city. “I knew he’d be very worried about us; I tried calling him many times that night. I got through to his brother the next day, and he passed on the message that we were safe,” she recalls.

After three days, Ms Kovaleva and her neighbour went back to their respective homes to collect essential items and their pets: a dog and two cats. They returned to the Heroiv Pratsi metro station, where they have been living ever since, sleeping in tents on the platform and seldom venturing out.

Over time, a degree of structure has been established in the subterranean community. A medical clinic has been set up, food is provided by welfare groups and religious organisations, and there are online lessons for children. There is even a makeshift nail parlour. The tracks, with trains no longer running, are used to walk from station to station by those seeking places to stay.

Danger, however, is never far away. A supermarket near Heroiv Pratsi was struck by a missile recently, injuring eight people and killing three others who were queueing for food, one of them a woman who had been sheltering in the station.

Anastasia Kharkova, an activist staying at the station, describes the attempts to introduce a semblance of normality to the community, which exists in such proximity to the violence above ground.

“It was decided early on that this war could go on for a very long time, and all efforts must be made to make life work down here. A lot of people volunteered – people came out of retirement to help. The authorities did the best they could, I think,” she says. “There has also been a lot of help from the churches and people of different faiths; we are all very grateful for that.”

A group from a Hare Krishna temple comes with soup, bread and sweets to provide lunch. Yesterday it was the turn of a Baptist church. “We are all working together, doing what we can,” says one of the Hare Krishna followers. “We don’t discuss religion; we are just helping each other out,” he adds, as his companions chant with cymbals and drums.

Lubov Mimilova, a social worker, has been setting up playgroups for families in the stations. There are drawings by children on the walls, games and parties organised. “What is happening is obviously having a deep impact on these boys and girls,” she says. “Letting them express their feelings is important, but it is also very important to let them hold on to their childhood as much as possible under the circumstances.”

There is a queue at platform 2 for Viktoria Gondarova, a beautician offering nail polishing. “Everyone wants to help. This is what I do in my working life, and so I thought, why not offer this service? This will be something which will remind women of their life before the war, cheer them up a bit,” she says. “Everyone needs cheering up at a time like this.”

There are mental as well as physical issues to deal with for Elena Doro, a doctor at one of the city’s hospitals, who has set up a part-time surgery in what used to be the ticket office.

“We have had the usual illness at this station – coughs and colds, a few accidents with people falling, especially when they have been trying to get to the shelter in a rush because of the bombing,” she says. “There have also been two cases of Covid; it became pretty obvious that they had it when they arrived, and they were sent for treatment.

“But there are also psychological issues, of course, as one would expect from people being in this situation. One thing we have noticed is that some people have become afraid of open spaces, not being near others in an enclosed area. This is something which will need to be addressed when things get better.”

There are those on the platforms of Heroiv Pratsi who are convinced that things will start to get better.

“We are turning back the enemy: Kharkiv hasn’t been captured. Vladimir Putin has failed to conquer our country,” Nicolai Shevchenko says. “Staying down here has been distressing for us, but we have survived and we’ll be strong when we get out.

“Ukraine has suffered a lot of losses, a lot of pain, but our country is united. We will be stronger after what has happened, we have no doubt about that.”

CNN has geolocated and verified 13 incidents involving civilians over the past three days, as attacks intensified on Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people. following Ukraine’s resistance.

Most of the attacks took place in the northeastern part of Kharkiv in the residential area of ​​Saltivka. But other districts in the northwest, southeast and southwest of the city were also affected. The city’s Freedom Square, the center of public life in Kharkiv, was hit with was believed to be a cruise missile, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister said.

In 24 hours, 34 civilians were killed and 285 injured — including 10 children — in the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said on Thursday morning.

As the Kharkiv offensive ramped up, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague announced on Wednesday that he had launched an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Russia’s relentless bombardment of Kharkiv, including the deliberate targeting of residential areas with “jet artillery,” as a “war crime” in a late-night address on Monday.

CNN has analyzed and verified digital evidence, including videos and photos, of several indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv.

Three schools hit by shelling in one day

At least three schools in Kharkiv were hit by Russian military strikes on Tuesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media.

In one clip, a school in the northern Saltivka neighborhood is pictured with a gaping hole in the wall, rubble and broken glass strewn across the courtyard.

“School number 17 of Kharkiv city,” someone can be heard saying in the video. “It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke.”

The other two schools hit in shelling were just over a kilometer (around 0.6 miles) apart, in an industrial district in Kharkiv’s southeastern area.

Schools have not been in session since the Russian invasion began.

Other schools were indirectly affected during the bombing of the center of Kharkiv on Tuesday. Viktor Kruglov, the founder of Ranok, a private school, said they managed to evacuate about 54 orphans from a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children just 15 minutes before the explosion.

However, 65 people are still holed up in the basement of the school — with no electricity or water due to the shelling. They’re relying on food and water brought by volunteers, according to Valentyna Butenko, head of the non-governmental organization “Right to Choose” (Pravo Vyboru).

The school is located 300 meters (approximately 985 feet) from the epicenter of the explosion in Freedom Square.

Apartment blocks directly hit

On Tuesday, two apartment buildings were directly hit, just outside City Kharkiv municipal hospital No 3. The strikes also hit an office building.

In one video, a fire rages at a damaged apartment complex just across the street from the hospital.

“The building is gone,” says someone in the video.

Another video shows children and family fleeing the apartment complex, and at least two bodies on the ground.

“…animals, simply animals,” someone said, appearing to refer to those responsible for the military strikes. “People were driving here.”

“A house,” another person said, adding, “Look at what they’ve done.”

CNN could not identify any military targets in the area.

Other footage from the Saltivka neighborhood, which was shared on local media, showed a row of shops in front of an apartment building destroyed by strikes. A nearby building was also seen on fire.

Security camera catches dramatic incident

Five residential neighborhoods of Kharkiv were hit on Monday, according to a CNN analysis.

What appeared to be surveillance-style footage of an apartment complex on Velyka Kil’tseva Street captured panicked residents rushing for safety as rockets exploded around them.

The intense shelling — at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard — lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running away. One individual is seen falling to the ground as explosions dot the ground around. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. After the hail of strikes stop, the individual that fell appears to crawl away, but then stops moving. Their condition is unknown to CNN.

Apartment complexes on Klochkivska Street in northwestern Kharkiv, and on Vasylia Stusa Street in eastern Kharkiv were also hit on Monday.

Multiple-launch rocket system attack near supermarket

The Saltivka neighborhood was also hit by a multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS, attack on Monday.

Videos geolocated by CNN show multiple rockets exploding closely together near the Equator supermarket, while shoppers scramble to safety.

One video shows a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as some people look at it.

According to the Kharkiv City Council, that shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 wounded. The wounded are made up of 15 servicemen and 16 civilians, says the city council in a press statement. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.

Dan Kaszeta, a defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London, said the images were consistent with a multiple rocket launch system attack.

“The appearance of at least one image of a rocket booster section lends credence to this having been a rocket attack,” he said.

Commenting on that attack, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, said: “Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims.”

He described the situation as “a nightmare.”",https://nationworldnews.com/russia-sends-a-message-to-all-of-ukraine-by-hitting-these-civilian-areas-in-this-city/

The first day of April was very warm. The breath of spring can already be felt. The day was relatively quiet.

Although the silence I’m talking about is relative. There was no major shelling during the day, but some did occur periodically. There were waves of shelling of low and medium intensity, the usual morning activity of muscovites, followed by a short lunch break. The evening was marked by further muscovite activity at the end of the day, although prior to that things were quiet.

The muscovite “liberation gifts” usually hit Saltivka (in particular Northern Saltivka), Velyka Danylivka, the villages of Zhukovsky, Oleksiyivka, Obriy, and the Kharkiv Tractor Plant neighborhood. Of course, the strikes caused fires to occasionally break out in the northeast and southeast of the city. The smoke from these fires could be seen from at least a few kilometers away. In Oleksiyivka, two people died from the rushist shelling. There was also shelling in the vicinity of the Mashynobudivnykiv Park and the village of Artem (yes, the popular toponymic name of Artem’s Park, which is now called Mashinobudivnikiv, still exists). There is damage to some industrial enterprises in the area, particularly Turboatom and HEMZ (translator’s note: Kharkiv Electromechanical Plant).

The rocket attack on the Kharkiv Regional State Administration building, which took place exactly a month ago, killed 29 people. This number was mentioned by the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, Oleg Sinegubov.

Kharkiv is defending the city and its surroundings. Our military is ready for any scenario, particularly one where some of the troops that withdrew from Kyivappear near Kharkiv.

Public utility workers continue to clean up the city and repair water supply networks, even in areas where they could be shelled at any time. They don’t pay attention to the explosions at all. These people are made of titanium. I don’t even know how much endurance they must have to work in these conditions. Many people are coming out to clean up their neighborhoods, particularly those where it’s become quieter. After all, we’re not used to living in shit, like the orcs are.

Kharkiv city authorities have decided that utility bills for city residents will be paused until martial law is lifted. The payments will be covered by the city. In fact, few people can afford to pay utility bills now.

The city is coming back to life. More and more markets, shops, and kiosks are open, sometimes even “Kulinichi” (translator’s note: a popular restaurant)! Clothing stores, shops selling household goods, and others are opening as well. The selection in supermarkets and shops is good, though not yet what it was before the start of the large-scale invasion. But there’s been just unbelievable progress over these 37 days! And if during the first two weeks even buying a minimum set of products for survival was a problem, now it feels like heaven on earth. These feelings are difficult to describe.

Meanwhile, queues at shops and supermarkets are gradually disappearing due to the consistent deliveries of products and goods, even places on the outskirts of the city. Of course, this is not the case in areas where there is constant shelling. There are no more queues in the pharmacies of the kind we saw over the past month, because there are many pharmacies now open, not just one per district, as was the case in the first three weeks of war. Pharmacies in general have a good selection of at least the most popular drugs. Of course, there are problems with everything else.

Certainly, the situation is very difficult in the areas that are constantly under fire. Many shops and supermarkets are damaged, and there is still no power. Northern Saltivka, part of the Saltivka residential district, Obriy, areas most affected by shelling, do not have any shops open at all. There is nothing there, all the shops and markets have been destroyed or burned down. No humanitarian aid is coming in from the regional logistics center because of the threat of shelling by the russists. Many places have no power and/or gas. Despite this, there are still small groups of people there living in basements. Many survive with the help of volunteers who bring food. These people refuse the opportunity to leave. Some have become unstable because they’re permanently living in basements, even though shelling is not as intense as in the first two weeks. They just refuse to go outside! I don’t know what to do with them.

One can already tell what sort of bomb has landed, whether it’s a mine, a shell, or jet artillery. Not that this is a good skill for a civilian to have, but it is what it is.

When you are constantly seeing places where people have died from muscovite shelling, when you’re seeing this chaos, you have to rate the fuckery, because otherwise it’s difficult to describe. You end up developing a “professional slang” of sorts.

There were also muscovite attacks on Derhachi and the community. There is always something landing there—daily. Also, in the vicinity of Chuhuiv and Pechenihy backyards of singleьfamily homes have been hit.

This is in stark contrast to the suburbs, which haven’t been shelled. Life there is absolutely quiet and peaceful! Today I couldn’t resist and bought a cider, my first drink with some alcohol content since the beginning of the attack on Kharkiv.

The muscovites, unfortunately, took control of Izyum, because of the traitors from OPFL (translator’s note: Opposition Platform For Life). But the fighting continues on its outskirts, with our soldiers defending those areas. The muscovites are trying to go around Izyum from the flanks to advance to Slovyansk. People have evacuated from Barvinkove ​​and nearby villages to avoid great casualties in case russists attack Slovyansk from the other direction. It’s the right thing to do.

Due to the fact that shelling, rockets, and air strikes on Kharkiv damaged all the buildings of the Karazin University, the school will be temporarily relocated to another city in Ukraine. These are the realities. According to police, 394 people perished in 37 days in the Kharkiv region, including 21 children. This number probably does not include data from the temporarily muscovite-occupied territories in the region.

Fighting continues for Rubizhne and along the entire line of the Joint Forces Operation, which has retained its shape in the north of Donetsk region. But so far there have been no active offensives, because the Russian scum is waiting for reinforcements from those units that are withdrawing from the northern and eastern directions of Kyiv. At the same time, not all troops have withdrawn, and the fight near Kyiv continues, even though our military has already taken Bucha and entered Hostomel. The photo of the burned AN-225 “Mriya”is very sad. Fighting continues in Chernihiv and northeastern Kyiv. That is to say that the muscovite “departure” hasn’t been easy for us. There are successes in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

But the muscovites have made peace with the withdrawal of troops from Kyiv and have reached the stage of acceptance. Just yesterday they objected and were angry. It’s been a rather quick change.

Things aren’t calm in the Belgorod region, or, as Oleksiy Danilov put it, the Belgorod People’s Republic. In the morning, muscovite helicopters bombed an oil depot near Belgorod, and then, according to OSINT(Open Source Intelligence), fired on their own field near the village Nikolskoe. Something flew toward the border of Ukraine, not from Ukraine.

Of course, Ukraine was blamed in both cases. Our officials say that the local authorities are responsible for everything that happens across the border. In the morning, there was panic in Belgorod, long queues formed at gas stations, and the governor of the Belgorod region tried to calm the population down so much that he named the location of another oil depot, the City of Gubkin. And we will write it down, for the future.

Of course, all this is designed for the Muscovites, in order to scrape up resources for further fighting through covert mobilization.

But in a country where more than 80% support the destruction of Ukraine and Ukrainians, this can have a completely different effect. When you were promised to take Kyiv in three days and instead something starts to constantly explode near you, fear sets in. This is different from what happened on Kashira Highway and in Volgograd, when the opinion of muscovites was being swayed to support the Second Chechen War. This will have a different effect: panic. The psychology of the population of the invader and of those who are defending their land is different: there is a different mentality among the muscovites than among us. They will feel fear and panic and attempt to hide from the war and covert mobilization. This is not happening today, but soon it will.

It is difficult to find the correct analogy to compare the present with the past because we are now in the age of the internet, and these are completely different circumstances from those that existed in the First or Second World War with Germany, although the analogies are relevant.

HIGHLIGHTS

• The World Food Programme (WFP) has assisted 1 million people in the eastern, northern and southern oblasts of Ukraine since 24 February. WFP continues to build up its food stocks in the country, pre-positioning close to 40,000 tons of bulk food, mostly procured locally, as it aims to reach more than 3 million people with food and cash assistance in the country.

• The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is supporting the procurement of more than 14 tons of liquefied chlorine for water purification to support the weekly operations of the Kharkiv Vodokanal water system (Kharkivska oblast, east). This will help ensure access to safe water for approximately 900,000 people in some of the hardest-hit areas of eastern Ukraine.

• The Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) has reached more than 400,000 people across the country with multisectoral assistance, dispatching more than 1,000 tons of aid.

• As of 31 March, nearly 18,500 people across Ukraine have received multipurpose cash assistance totaling US$3.2 million from UN agencies and humanitarian partners. As growing numbers of people are registered at a faster pace, these figures are expected to increase quickly.

• Human Rights Watch (HRW) has documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north), Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north), including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an independent investigation to bring about effective accountability, an appeal echoed by the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine Osnat Lubrani.

• In less than six weeks, the civilian death toll (1,430) of the ongoing military offensive has already surpassed the total number of civilian deaths from the last seven years of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine combined (1,320 civilians killed in 2015-2021).

SITUATION OVERVIEW

General humanitarian situation. The situation in the hard-hit eastern, northern and southern areas of Ukraine is becoming increasingly dire. Unmet needs continue to accumulate as access to food, water, medicines and other basic necessities remains severely restricted. Ongoing clashes prevent people trapped in partially or fully encircled cities from safely evacuating while simultaneously blocking much-needed aid from reaching those most in need. Some of the worst-affected areas include Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson (Khersonska oblast, south), areas surrounding Kyiv, Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), Okhtyrka (Sumska oblast, north-east), Izium (Kharkivska oblast), Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast, east), Trostianets (Sumska oblast), Volnovakha (Donetska oblast) and Sumy (Sumska oblast), as well as settlements in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts located close to the areas of active fighting.

As of 3 April, the civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive stands at 3,527 – including 1,430 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,198 casualties – including 405 killed and 793 injured – compared to 320 civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (67 killed and 253 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 2,009 civilian casualties.

In less than six weeks, the civilian death toll of the ongoing military offensive already surpassed the total number of civilian deaths from the last seven years (2015-2021) of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine combined, when around 1,320 civilians were killed. The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely much higher and will continue to rise as fighting intensifies in the eastern and southern parts of the country.

Damages and losses. The Ministry of Economy says that Ukraine’s economy shrunk by 16 per cent between January and April this year, projecting a 40 per cent decline by the end of 2022 – double of the recent projection issued by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal says that economic losses due to the ongoing military offensive may exceed $1 trillion. As of 3 April, Ukravtodor – the state-owned road construction company – estimates that around 23,000 km of roads have been damaged or destroyed, causing approximately UAH874 billion ($29.73 billion) in damage, while more than 270 road infrastructures, like bridges and overpasses, have been destroyed.

Laws-of-war violations. Between 27 February and 14 March, HRW documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv, Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital, including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia. These violations include a case of repeated rape in Kharkiv, summary executions, and unlawful violence and threats against civilians. There are also reports of looting of civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood, by the Russian Federation forces in different parts of the country. HRW says that all parties in Ukraine must abide by international law, including the Geneva Conventions, international law of occupation and international human rights law, adding that those who have committed these abuses are responsible for war crimes.

In Bucha, a small town around 30 km northwest of Kyiv, the bodies of at least 20 civilian men were found on a single street following the withdrawal of the Russian Federation forces. According to Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk, more than 300 civilianswere killed – 280 are reportedly buried in mass graves – some of whom received inhumane treatment reportedly at the hands of the Russian Federation forces. UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his shock at the gruesome images coming out of Bucha, calling for an independent investigation to bring about effective accountability, a sentiment echoed by the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine and many world leaders.

Northern Ukraine and capital area. Despite claims that the military offensive on Kyiv and surrounding areas is being scaled back, on 3 April, missile strikes hit Vasylkiv – a small town of 36,000 people about 32 km outside Kyiv – leaving several civilians injured. As the Russian Federation forces reportedly retreat from some of the hardest-hit areas in and around the capital, the extent of destruction and civilian casualties is becoming more apparent.

According to Kyiv City Council, more than 150 residential buildings and over 70 schools have been damaged since 24 February in the capital. Still, the gravest humanitarian consequences of the ongoing military offensive are seen in towns outside Kyiv, like Bucha, Irpin and Motyzhyn, where local authorities say civilians have been purposely killed, some reportedly shot in the back of the head with their hands tied behind their backs. According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, as of 3 April, at least 410 bodies have been discovered in towns near Kyiv.

In Irpin – around 25 km northwest of the capital – weeks of intense clashes have left people in desperate need of safe water, food, generators, and plastic sheets and tarpaulins to help insulate and conduct partial repairs of damaged homes.

Just 3,500 of Irpin’s 60,000 pre-escalation population remains in the ravaged town, with only the most vulnerable, including older persons and people with disabilities, still there. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reports that Irpin is only accessible by land cruiser as the streets remain littered with unexploded ordnance. On 2 April, Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said that more than 640 explosive devices were deactivated in Irpin, adding that the extent of unexploded ordnance contamination will prevent people from returning to what remains of their homes and communities for at least a month as authorities clear out large quantities of explosive devices.

In neighbouring Chernihivska oblast, the oblast capital Chernihiv – currently home to only 130,000 people after half the preescalation population fled amid escalating tensions – authorities report that there is no centralized heating and limited electricity and gas supply in the city. URCS reports that residents in Chernihiv have been without water for more than three weeks after the city’s centralized water supply was destroyed by shelling, generating acute water needs as water supplies are running out. On 3 April, the mayor of Chernihiv Vladyslav Atroshenko said that approximately 70 per cent of the city was destroyed following weeks of relentless attacks. As the humanitarian situation worsens, the city remains cut off from areas controlled by Ukraine since the main bridge over the Desna River, leading out of the city south toward Kyiv, was destroyed on 23 March, making it difficult for much-needed aid to reach those most in need.

Eastern Ukraine continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing military offensive. Fears are growing that already-violent clashes and intense shelling will only worsen as the Russian Federation forces double down on taking control of the Donbas region following a series of setbacks in their attempts to encircle Kyiv.

On 2 April, active hostilities in Lozova (Kharkivska oblast) reportedly killed at least four people and damaged homes and other critical infrastructure, leaving more than 60,000 residents cut off from the water supply and another 40,000 without electricity. That same day, the Governor of Kharkivska oblast reported that a hospital in Balakliia – a small town in the Izium district (raion) – was partially destroyed.

On 3 April, intense shelling in the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv – the country’s second-largest city – left at least seven people dead and nearly three dozen injured, including three children, according to the oblast prosecutor’s office. Additionally, at least 10 homes and a trolley bus depot were damaged. Local authorities report that other areas on the outskirts of Kharkiv were also shelled on 4 April, including Derhachi, Pyatykhatky and Saltivka. In Derhachi, on 3 April, three civilians were killed and seven others injured after a residential neighbourhood was shelled.

In Izium, the setting of the most intense clashes across Kharkivska oblast, Deputy Mayor Volodymyr Matsokin says that 80 per cent of residential buildings have been destroyed. The city and surrounding suburbs, like Kamianka, Sukha and Topalske, remain completely cut off. Around 15,000-20,000 people are still trapped in Izium, where they lack electricity, heat and safe water, and require immediate humanitarian assistance and safe evacuation corridors. Meanwhile, in Luhanska oblast, hostilities are intensifying in Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast). On 3 April, two volunteers were reportedly killed while attempting to deliver aid to affected people in Novodruzhesk (Luhanska oblast).

On 3 April, signs of an impending escalation pushed the head of the Donetska Oblast State Administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, to call on residents to leave the oblast, adding that authorities will facilitate evacuations, although active hostilities in several locations may hinder the safe movement of people. In recent days, towns across the oblast have come under constant attack, including Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka, Mariinka, Svitlodarsk and Vuhledar, while the humanitarian situation in Mariupol and Volnovakha remains acute.

Southern Ukraine. Attacks across the country’s southern oblasts, including Khersonska, Mykolaivska and Odeska, are becoming increasingly more frequent and devastating. Several missiles struck Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast) and Odesa (Odeska oblast) during the reporting period, hitting residential areas and civilian infrastructure. On 1 April, multiple missiles hit the Odeskyi district (raion) from the direction of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, leaving at least two dead and another 15 wounded.

In Mykolaiv, airstrikes on 3 April left one person dead and more than a dozen injured. As of 4 April, the civilian death toll from the 29 March attack on the Mykolaiv Oblast State Administration building has risen to 36 as search-and-rescue crews continue to comb through the rubble in search of survivors. Attacks in Mykolaiv also damaged a children’s hospital, an orphanage and an oncology centre; and at least 14 people were injured. In neighbouring Ochakiv – a port town with some 15,000 inhabitants – at least seven people were killed and nearly 20 injured by missile strikes on 3 April.

Civilian evacuations. Between 1 and 3 April, the Government of Ukraine says that nearly 13,180 people were evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors, including just over 2,000 people from Mariupol, nearly 1,170 from southeastern Zaporizka oblast (Berdiansk, Melitopol, Polohu, Orikhiv and Vasylivka) and more than 5,850 from Luhanska oblast (Kreminna, Lysychansk, Nyzhne, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk).

At the time of writing, evacuation processes for residents of Mariupol are underway, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, with 15 buses departing from Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast) en route to Mariupol and another seven from the ICRC heading from Manhush (Donetska oblast, NGCA). In Luhanska oblast, despite agreed-upon evacuation corridors out of Lysychansk, Nyzhne, Popasna and Rubizhne today, at the time of writing, continued shelling in the Hirska community (hromada), including airstrikes in Hirske, Popasna and Zolote, will likely prevent evacuations.

Meanwhile, on 3 April, the Russian Federation reported that 16,648 people, including nearly 2,442 children, were evacuated from affected areas to the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that 602,106 people, including more than 119,847 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine. In addition, the Russian Federation reports that 125,616 persons were evacuated from Mariupol to date, including 1,784 persons on 3 April.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-4-april-2022
