2,b0a7538f-4112-46fd-9ccb-c0cb0574802f,[],,"Local officials in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson have described their shock and disbelief as Russian troops attacking from Crimea overwhelmed their defences.

Early on the morning of February 24, Russian soldiers were deployed from occupied Crimea. In a matter of hours, they reached Nova Kakhovka, in the centre of the Kherson region, and nearby Oleshek. By mid-morning, the Russians had seized Nova Kakhovka’s Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station and captured the North Crimean Canal in the neighbouring city of Tavriysk.

Municipal officials complained about the lack of communication with the regional and state authorities. Tavriysk mayor Mykola Rizak said that he immediately informed the leadership of the Kherson regional state administration.

“I told them about the capture of the channel, but they did not believe it,” he said. “And I have a question: how could Russian tanks, Grads and armoured personnel carriers pass from Armyansk to Tavriysk in four hours? Where is our first echelon of defence [or] the second, about which the regional authorities told us many times and reassured us that everything will be fine? Where are they?”

There was heavy fighting in the area of ​​the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station - which was occupied by Russian forces - and on the outskirts of Kherson. Wounded Russian soldiers were taken to the Novokakhovskaya city hospital and there were also civilian casualties, including at least three people killed due to shelling in Oleshki. On February 24, on a highway near the village of Tsukury in the Tavrian region, a Russian armoured personnel carrier hit a car. The passenger died at the scene, and the driver remains in critical condition.

In the late afternoon of February 25, the head of the regional state administration Gennady Laguta announced the loss of control over the Antonovsky Bridge, the main crossing to Kherson across the Dnieper from the city of Oleshki.

“The enemy overcame the city’s defences with great force and heavy losses,” he posted on Facebook. “We urge you to remain calm and not panic. The regional leadership is making every effort to maintain law and order and save lives. The situation remains tense, but we promise to do everything possible to resolve it.”

Laguta said that the situation in the Kherson region remained tense.

“In the Genichesk region, all state structures came under the control of the invaders,” he said. “Russian [military] equipment stands in Genichesk itself; on its outskirts there are checkpoints with Russian troops. They check those entering whether they belonging to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.”

Fighting continued in Nova Kakhovka. At about noon on February 25, Russian troops seized the administrative building of the Novokakhovka city council. However, a few hours later, the soldiers left the city council building, according to Nova Kakhovka mayor Volodymyr Kovalenko.

“They negotiated with me and my deputies,” he said. “They listened to our wishes, among which were to keep tanks and armoured vehicles off the city’s streets. After that, they removed the security from the building and departed in an unknown direction.”

Kovalenko said that he was working day and night to try and keep the city functioning, with all communication with the regional authority lost. Others fear a power vaccum, with some local counsellors having evacuated and the police, state security service and prosecutor's office not functioning in either Novo Kakhovka or Kakhovka.

To prevent looting, Kakhovka was patrolled by the local volunteers, and 20 representatives of the municipal security organisations helped maintain calm in Nova Kakhova.

“Regarding weapons, we had only two [non-lethal] pistols and the aim to prevent widespread looting,” said local resident Sergiy Tsigipa, one of the organisers of the local defence battalion.

“We're in hell here,” said Lyudmila Annas, the village of Vesyoloye. “Since seven in the morning on February 25, they have been bombing, there are many Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers in the village. They go everywhere: along the streets, gardens of local residents. There is a lot of Russian military equipment on the village sports fields, a whole military unit of them stands nearby. Hot shrapnel falls on the adjacent areas. People are afraid to leave the house.”

Berislav mayor Oleksandr Shapovalov told IWPR that the entire area had been left without power.

“We had an electricity blackout in the town and in all the surrounding villages. There were disruptions in supplying bread to the local hospital, however later on the 25th we started to resolve these issues.”

Roads were damaged in other large communities of the Kakhovskya district.

“Local authorities are now trying to repair these damages,” said local mayor Maksim Kolokot.

The swift progress of the invasion at first shocked the local authorities of the Kherson oblast. Mayors and local officials complained about the lack of communication with the district authorities and the lack of access to key information on the first day of the war.

For now, major infrastructure remains under the control of Russia.

“They check everyone incoming to the city whether they are members of the Ukraine army or not,” said Genadi Laguta, head of the Kherson oblast. “The Kahovskaya hydro power station is under the control of the enemy. Large military machinery also moved towards Berislav district as well as to Skadovskaya.”",https://iwpr.net/global-voices/ukraine-russian-troops-continue-offensive-crimea

Russian forces have launched an invasion of Ukraine, with troops entering the country from the east, from Belarus in the north, and Crimea in the south.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address, announcing a military operation to demilitarise and ‘de-nazify’ Ukraine.

Ukraine’s air defence systems have largely been disabled.

Multiple cities across the country have been struck by missiles and artillery shells, including Kyiv, Odessa, Kharkiv, and Mariupol.

Ukraine has declared a state of emergency and closed its airspace to all civilian traffic.

Road and rail routes out of the country are largely congested due to the number of people attempting to evacuate.

Situation

Early on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address to the nation during which he announced the commencement of a military operation to demilitarise and ‘de-nazify’ Ukraine. President Putin warned other countries against inhibiting Russia’s actions in Ukraine, stating that Russia’s actions would lead to “consequences that you have never faced in your history”. While Vladimir Putin was still talking, multiple explosions were reported around the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Following this, explosions targeted areas of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Ivano-Frankivsk, and more. The Russian forces subsequently launched a campaign to disable Ukraine’s air defence systems, primarily targeting military airbases.



Following the initial stages, columns of Russian ground forces entered Ukrainian territory from the east, from Belarus in the north, and from Crimea in the south. Armed clashes have occurred between Ukrainian and Russian forces in multiple areas of the country. The use of thermobaric, cruise and ballistic missile systems has been documented, primarily against military structures. One of the heaviest confrontations is believed to be around Antonov International Airport in Hostomel, approximately 25 kilometres northwest of central Kyiv. Videos have been shared online showing Russian attack helicopters surrounding the airport, with large columns of smoke emerging from the site.

Ground forces are also believed to be engaging in combat at the airport. The level of fighting in close proximity to Kyiv has raised concerns that Russian forces will attempt to capture the capital city in the coming hours. Heavy fighting has also been recorded around the Antonovskiy Bridge, leading into Kherson, and Russian forces are believed to have entered the city. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has alleged that four ballistic missiles have been fired from Belarusian territory in the southwest direction.

The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced that Russian forces are attempting to gain control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, calling the action “a declaration of war against the whole of Europe”. Although the primary targets appear to be military bases and infrastructure, civilian casualties have been documented on several occasions. A video has surfaced showing a fighter jet firing at least two rockets towards a civilian housing complex. The exact figures of civilian and military fatalities are unavailable.



The previous night, Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada approved a 30-day state of emergency to be imposed at midnight. The state of emergency allows the country’s authorities to restrict freedom of movement, inspect vehicles, ""strengthen the protection of public order"", restrict the sale of alcohol and weapons, prohibit public gatherings, impose curfews, and regulate broadcast outlets. Then, following the invasion, the Ukrainian government imposed martial law and closed the country’s airspace. Currently, civilian flights are disallowed from operating services to and from Ukraine, limiting evacuation options. Multiple roads leading west have become heavily congested, due to the volume of people attempting to evacuate the country. Likewise, videos surfaced today showing large crowds queuing outside Kyiv’s main railway station (Pasazhyrskyi), implying that rail options are also congested.

Russia’s actions have been met with widespread international condemnation. The United Kingdom’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, delivers a televised address during which he denounced Russia’s actions, labelling President Putin as a “dictator”, and stated that a “massive package” of sanctions will be imposed, asserting “we will do whatever it takes” to support Ukraine. Moldova and Latvia have both declared a state of emergency, while the Finnish Prime Minister, Sanna Marin, has announced that her country is ready to apply for NATO membership, “if it becomes a matter of national security”. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, has labelled the invasion as a “brutal act of war” and announced that the bloc is increasing its presence in the eastern European members and heightening the readiness of the NATO Response Force. At an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting, each member was largely critical of the Russian invasion, and the Ukrainian ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, stated that Russia has declared war on Ukraine.



Analysis and Implications

The Russian authorities are believed to have several objectives in conducting its invasion of Ukraine. Primarily, it is understood that Russia is seeking to remove the incumbent Ukrainian authorities from power. Russia views the post-2014 Ukrainian governments as a threat to its national security, hence the operation to demilitarise the country. It remains to be seen whether Russia will annex any more of Ukraine’s territory. However, it is probable that if Russia is successful in removing Ukraine’s administration, it will install a new pro-Russian government. In such an event, it is possible that an insurgency will be carried out by the Ukrainian population, something that is being actively encouraged by the country’s armed forces.

President Zelensky announced that Ukraine will give weapons to anyone willing to defend it, stating that people should “be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities”. If this occurs, it is possible that Russian troops could remain in Ukraine for an extended period to quell any pockets of resistance. Already, videos have surfaced showing troops from Rosgvardiya deployed inside Ukrainian territory, specifically, in Henichesk, situated in the Kherson Oblast. Rosgvardiya constitutes Russia’s domestic armed forces who have previously been deployed to Belarus in order to quell protest activities. This suggests that the Russian government is planning a long-term operation in Ukraine.



The invasion of Ukraine is already having impacts on global financial markets, and sanctions are likely to worsen the situation. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion’s commencement, the value of the Russian rouble fell by approximately 20 percent, before achieving a slight recovery. The price of oil has reached its highest level since 2014, at 105 USD per barrel. The FTSE 100 share index fell this morning by 3 percent, London-listed Russian company Sberbank’s share price fell by 61 percent and Gazprom’s fell by 28 percent. Wheat prices have also increased sharply, to approximately 390 USD per tonne, which is thought to be the largest price rise for nine years. The full scale of economic impact remains to be seen, but fuel and gas prices are expected to rise.



The risk to traveller safety is critical, civilian fatalities have been reported on multiple occasions and there is no guarantee that fighting will happen exclusively outside civilian zones. Worsening the risk, are the limited availability of transport options. With all civilian flights suspended alongside road and rail options being heavily congested, it is likely that difficulties will arise when attempting to evacuate the country. Ukrainian authorities have set up bomb shelters in the major cities, including the capital, many of which are in underground railway stations.

The United States Embassy to Ukraine currently advises that people should shelter-in-place. Both sides have accused the other of spreading lies and launching disinformation campaigns, indicating that verifiable information is limited, possibility impeding the ability of travellers to keep abreast of the current situation.





Advice

Defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine.

Ensure that travel passports and travel documents are up to date and regularly review possible departure options.

Where applicable, travellers in Ukraine should familiarise themselves with plans to evacuate the country and/or implement robust security measures.

Regularly monitor reputable national and international news reports for situational updates over the coming days and weeks, keeping in mind the rifeness of disinformation campaigns.

Marine battalion engineer Vitaly Skakun Volodymyrovych was deployed to the Henichesk bridge in the southern province of Kherson when the Russian tanks advanced, the Ukrainian military said on its Facebook page.

“On this difficult day for our country, when the Ukrainian people give way to the Russian occupiers in all directions, one of the hardest places on the map of Ukraine was the Crimean intersection, where one of the first enemies met a separate marine battalion,” according to the post.

When the battalion decided that the only way to block the armored column was by blowing up the bridge, Volodymyrovych volunteered to place mines on the span, the General Staff of the Armed Forces said.

And when he realized he had no time to get to safety, the brave soldier made the ultimate sacrifice on the bridge, which connected Russian-occupied Crimea and mainland Ukraine.

Volodymyrovych’s bravery slowed the Russian advance.

“According to his brothers in arms, Vitaly got in touch [with them] and said he was going to blow up the bridge. Immediately after an explosion rang out,” the military said.

“Our brother was killed. His heroic act significantly slowed down the push of the enemy, allowing the unit to relocate and organize the defense,” the statement said.

Today is a major day in the Russian military operation. Why?

Because Russian forces are now on the outskirts of many major Ukrainian cities. If yesterday was “standoff weapons” day, today is the first day when Russian forces can now begin to degrade Ukrainian artillery dispositions, engage Ukie armor and break through Ukrainian fortifications. Today is also the last day for US PSYOPs to try to present a counter-narrative (Ukies heroically resisting, Russian dying in huge numbers, effective counter-attacks, etc.).

Yet we live in the smartphone with camera era and picture like this one tell the full story:

What you see in this picture are immense traffic jams of folks fleeing not Mariupol or Kramatorsk, but Kiev, the capital.

Here is a quick machine translated news update from Col. Cassad:

1. LDNR – the positional nature of the fighting remains, with attempts by the LDNR armies to advance to the borders of the territories occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

2. The southern direction – the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation retained control over the bridge over the Dnieper at Kherson, repulsing attempts of counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.. Fighting in the Antonovsky Bridge area continues.

A New Kakhovka is also being held. Melitopol was taken this morning and the advance towards Berdyansk began.

3. Kharkiv direction – fighting continues on the near approaches to Kharkov. Both sides are suffering losses in people and equipment.

4. Sumy direction – the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation took Putivl and passing through Sumy (the battle at the airport continued there today), advanced to Konotop, surrounding the city. Today, attempts to take Akhtyrka continued in order to reach Kharkov from the west. There are Russian roadblocks on the Sumy-Kiev highway. There is an advance to Kiev and Chernihiv. (The APU repelled the attack of the Russian Armed Forces in the Chernihiv direction).

5. Kiev – Gostomel airfield is held by paratroopers. The APU could not dislodge them from there. This morning, tank columns of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation broke through to the near approaches to Kiev and are close to establishing direct communication with the landing. The AFU is preparing a counterattack, stating that another landing will be thrown out in the Gostomel area today. The Pentagon says that Kiev will fall in the coming days. After 10 o’clock shooting was heard in the city. Also, according to the statement of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the landing was thrown to the west of Zhytomyr. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively undermining bridges on the approaches, trying to slow down the advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,

6. In the morning, strikes continued on military facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the territory of Ukraine. A Su-27 of the Ukrainian Air Force was shot down over Kiev – according to one version by the Russian air defense system, according to another – by the Ukrainian ones. The downed “Caliber” fell on a residential building in Kiev, but there were no casualties. During the shelling of Gorlovka, a school was hit – 2 teachers were killed.

7. The AFU launched a missile attack on the Millerovo airfield on the territory of the Russian Federation. Damage is reported at the airfield, but there are no losses in aircraft.

I now leave you with an open thread, please try to stick to FACTUAL INFORMATION and please refrain from prophecies about the future or stream of consciousness about the present.

One more thing: today Putin appealed to the Ukrainian soldiers and told them not to let the Banderistas to rule over them, he basically called for them to take power and negotiate with Russia. Ukie generals need to think hard about what they will do next.

I will try to post an analysis of the day later today.

The Chernobyl NPP is reportedly under the control of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

Su-27 of the Ukrainian Air Force was destroyed at the airfield near Zhytomyr:

Despite various reports by the MSM, Belorussia does not take part in the military operation in Ukraine, but Minsk is ready to support Russia in case of any aggression on its territory.

Kiev is spreading the fake news that two Russian soldiers were captured. The photo provided to support the claims was made at a winter time, there was no snow in Eastern Ukraine for at least two weeks.

According to open sources, the UAF have at least one Russian serviceman captured. The deaths of at least two Russian soldiers were confirmed by the videos. 4 servicemen of the LPR were reportedly captured. However, the claims are yet to be confirmed.

Russian troops do not target civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, as well as social facilities of the Ukrainian military garrisons, including barracks and residential buildings, in order to avoid casualties among Ukrainian military personnel and their family members.

Russian Defense Ministry Sergey Shoigu ordered to all unit commanders to treat Ukrainian servicemen with respect.

“Taking into account the fact that the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, unlike the nationalists, took the oath to the Ukrainian people and obeyed orders, treat them with respect. I ordered to work out the creation of safe corridors for the safe exit of Ukrainian servicemen who have laid down their arms from the areas of the operation to their families”

Podobnie jak wszystkie wcześniejsze wystąpienia, także i to miało posmak propagandowy, a nie informacyjny. Zresztą prawdopodobnie nagrano je z wyprzedzeniem. Putin ogłosił, że Rosja przeprowadzi operację wojskową w celu demilitaryzacji i denazyfikacji (!) Ukrainy oraz wezwał ukraińskich żołnierzy, aby złożyli broń i wrócili do domów. W praktyce całe jego przemówienie stanowiło wypowiedzenie wojny.

Wcześniej władze samozwańczych republik ludowych utworzonych pod egidą Kremla w Donbasie zwrócili się do Rosji z prośbą o pomoc w odparciu rzekomej agresji ze strony Ukraińców.Na marginesie można smutno skonstatować, że harmonogram inwazji pokrywał się – z tolerancją plus/minus kilku dni – bardzo dokładnie z ustaleniami NATO-wskich wywiadów. Rozumowanie o skuteczności CIA i MI6 na bazie wyłącznie sprawy broni masowego rażenia w Iraku okazało się zgubne.







Operację kinetyczną poprzedził zmasowany cyberatak – w dwóch osobnych falach – na ukraińskie rządowe serwisy internetowe. Wystąpiły także zakłócenia łączności, w tym telefonii komórkowej.

Około godziny 3.00 czasu polskiego Ukraina zamknęła całą swoją przestrzeń powietrzną. Niedługo potem dostrzeżono aktywność rosyjskiego systemu zarządzania lotnictwem strategicznym, zwany kolokwialnie Bearnet (od NATO-wskiego oznaczenia strategicznych nosicieli pocisków manewrujących Tu-95 – Bear). Sugeruje to przygotowania do ataków lotniczych na cele położone w głębi terytorium ukraińskiego.

Aktualizacja (4.40): Eksplozje słyszane w Kijowie to prawdopodobnie uderzenia pocisków manewrujących (lub być może pocisków balistycznych systemu Iskander?). Trzeba pamiętać, że we współczesnym konflikcie zbrojnym najważniejszym celem jest zawsze struktura dowodzenia i sieć łączności przeciwnika. Atak na stolicę jest logicznym elementem takiego ataku. Na razie nie wiadomo jednak, jakie są cele operacyjne i strategiczne Moskwy.







W Mariupolu doszło do bardzo silnej eksplozji. Według niepotwierdzonych doniesień miejsce wybuchu znajdowało się w na terenie portu morskiego.

Aktualizacja (5.10): W mieście Dniepr (dawny Dniepropetrowsk) eksplodował prawdopodobnie magazyn amunicji.







Pojawiają się też niepotwierdzone jeszcze informacje o desancie morskim w Odessie i właśnie w Mariupolu. Wiadomo, że Rosja ma na Morzu Azowskim niewielką flotyllą desantową (w jej skład wchodzą Nowoczerkassk i Cezar Kunikow projektu 775 oraz duży okręt desantowy Saratow projektu 1171 Tapir), a w Mariupolu desant morski może być dodatkowo wsparty desantem śmigłowcowym z Krymu.

Kolejne okręty desantowe przebywają na Morzu Czarnym. Są to te jednostki, o których ruchach pisaliśmy już wcześniej. W skład formacji wchodzą okręt desantowy Piotr Morgunow projektu 11711 oraz pięć okrętów desantowych projektu 775: Oleniegorskij gorniak, Gieorgij Pobiedonosiec, Korolow, Minsk i Kaliningrad. Pierwsze trzy należą do Floty Północnej, reszta – do Floty Bałtyckiej.

Trwa podobno natarcie Rosjan na kierunku charkowskim. Ukraina jest obecnie atakowana ze wszystkich trzech stron, z których Putin zgromadził wojska – w tym z Białorusi. Rosja prawdopodobnie będzie się starała odciąć wszystkie oddziały we wschodniej części Ukrainy, tak aby uniemożliwić im zarówno przyjście z pomocą stolicy, jak i wycofanie się w celu późniejszego przegrupowania. Pojawiło się również nagranie prawdopodobnie pierwszego zestrzelenia w tej wojnie. Pechowym statkiem powietrznym mógł być ukraiński UCAV Bayraktar TB2 produkcji tureckiej.







Aktualizacja (5.33): Prezydent Wołodymyr Zełenski zarządził ogłoszenie stanu wojennego na całym terytorium Ukrainy.

Amerykański senator Marco Rubio (wiceprezes senackiej komisji do spraw wywiadu, co w teorii powinno oznaczać, że jest dobrze poinformowany) pisze, iż rosyjskie wojska powietrznodesantowe starają się zająć podkijowskie lotnisko Boryspol, aby móc ściągnąć na nie dodatkowe siły. Nasz ulubiony analityk Rob Lee (którego naprawdę warto obserwować na Twitterze: @RALee85) zwraca uwagę, że niedawna misja pseudostabilizacyjna w Kazachstanie mogła dać Rosjanom cenne doświadczenia w tym zakresie. Uczestniczyły w niej 31. Samodzielna Gwardyjska Brygada Powietrznodesantowa i 45. Samodzielna Gwardyjska Brygada Specjalnego Przeznaczenia (tj. specnazu).

Aktualizacja (6.15): Według ministerstwa spraw wewnętrznych Ukrainy rosyjskie ataki pociągnęły już za sobą setki ofiar ľ zabitych i rannych.







Aktualizacja (6.40): Władze Ukrainy dementują wiadomości o desancie w Odessie. Potwierdzono za to informacje o atakach pociskami rakietowymi i manewrującymi na lotniska między innymi w Boryspolu, Ozernem koło Żytomierza, Czuhujewie w obwodzie charkowskim i Kramatorsku.

Aktualizacja (7.00): Siły zbrojne Ukrainy pochwaliły się zestrzeleniem pięciu rosyjskich samolotów i jednego śmigłowca na terenie obwodu ługańskiego. Informacja ta – podobnie jak większość informacji o sukcesach i stratach obu stron – jest niepotwierdzona. Będziemy się starali odnotowywać takie komunikaty na bieżąco, ale zawsze trzeba mieć na uwadze, że papier (czy raczej monitor) jest cierpliwy, a mgła wojny uniemożliwia szybką weryfikację.

Warto też podkreślić, że telefony, internet i telewizja na Ukrainie działają obecnie bez zakłóceń. Drogi wyjazdowe z Kijowa są jednak zablokowane przez setki samochodów z kijowianami próbującymi się ewakuować w bezpieczniejsze regiony kraju. Widać też kolejki samochodów przed stacjami benzynowymi.







Aktualizacja (7.20): W ataku na Czuhujiw (na południe od Charkowa) poważnie uszkodzony został blok mieszkalny. Dziennikarz Justin Yau, który wykonał to nagranie, pisze o ogromnej liczbie ofiar.

Ukraińcy podają, że jeden z zestrzelonych rosyjskich samolotów to bombowiec frontowy Su-24. Tymczasem w Kijowie sfotografowano szczątki pocisku przeciwradarowego Ch-31.

Rosjanie poinformowali już, że udało im się zneutralizować ukraińską obronę przeciwlotniczą. Owszem, neutralizacja dużych, względnie statycznych kompleksów, takich jak S-300, jest stosunkowo prosta przy takiej liczbie środków bojowych, jakie może rzucić do walki Rosja. Ale mniejsze i bardziej mobilne systemy, jak Kub/Kwadrat czy Osa, nie wspominając już o wyrzutniach „naramiennych”, stanowią dużo trudniejszy cel. O ich neutralizacji w tak krótkim czasie nie może być mowy.

Aktualizacja (8.05): Poniższe nagranie wykonano na lotnisku w Iwano-Frankiwsku na zachodniej Ukrainie. Rzekomo przedstawia uderzenie pocisku manewrującego rodziny Kalibr.







Po drugiej stronie kraju rosyjskie pododdziały zbliżają się do Charkowa – czterdzieści kilometrów od granicy. Nie znaczy to jednak, że Rosjanie już zaraz wkroczą do miasta. Teoretycznie mogą, ale w praktyce widzimy tu raczej najbardziej wysunięte pododdziały mające zabezpieczyć drogę do Charkowa.

Aktualizacja (8.20): Rumuńskie ministerstwo obrony poinformowało, że dziś około godziny 6.15 para myśliwców F-16 należących do Forțele Aeriene Române przechwyciła ukraińskiego Su-27, który wleciał w przestrzeń powietrzną Rumunii. Naruszyciela odeskortowano do 95. Bazy Lotniczej imienia kapitana Alexandru Șerbănescu w Bacău. Po lądowaniu pilot oddał się w ręce rumuńskich władz.

Możliwe są trzy wyjaśnienia tej sytuacji: albo ukraiński pilot uciekł do bezpiecznego kraju na włąsną rękę, albo ukraińskie wojska lotnicze postanowiły ewakuować przynajmniej część samolotów, które i tak na niewiele by się przydały w obliczu miażdżącej przewagi liczebnej nieprzyjaciela, albo też baza macierzysta tego samolotu została – już po jego starcie – zniszczona do tego stopnia, że pilot nie miał innego wyjścia jak tylko polecieć za granicę.

Aktualizacja (12.25): Nad Hostomelem w obwodzie kijowskim (są to obrzeża ukraińskiej stolicy) prawdopodobnie zestrzelono rosyjski śmigłowiec. W tym rejonie trwa prawdopodobna operacja wojsk aeromobilnych mająca doprowadzić do zajęcia lotniska w Hostomelu. Jest ono własnością przedsiębiorstwa Antonow i tam też znajdują się jego zakłady.







Poniższe nagranie wykonano w Wyszogrodzie, również na obrzeżach Kijowa. Widoczne jezioro to Zbiornik Kijowski na Dnieprze. Na początku filmu (24. sekunda) słychać odpalenie pocisku przeciwlotniczego z wyrzutni przenośnej, na co rosyjscy lotnicy od razu reagują wypuszczeniem flar.

Siły zbrojne Ukrainy pokazały zdjęcia pierwszych dwóch rosyjskich jeńców. Mają to być żołnierze 423. Gwardyjskiego Jampolskiego Pułku Strzelócw Zmotoryzowanych z Naro-Fomińska. W poniższym tweecie pomylono numer pułku z numerem porządkowym jednostki wojskowej – 91701. Zwracają uwagę czerwone taśmy identyfikacyjne, które mają chronić żołnierzy przed friendly fire.

Na obrzeżach Charkowa Rosjanie napotkali opór. Poniżej widać wieżę czołgu T-80BWM zerwaną z kadłuba przez eksplozję. Inne materiały pokazują zniszczone transportery opancerzone i zwłoki rosyjskich żołnierzy.

Aktualizacja (12.50): Ukraińcy pokazali z bliska zestrzelony śmigłowiec Ka-52 Ałligator. Pojawiły się również pogłoski o starciu myśliwców ukraińskich z rosyjskimi w pobliżu Kijowa. Prezydent Litwy Gitanas Nausėda zapowiedział podpisanie dekretu o o wprowadzeniu stanu wyjątkowego.







W tym momencie można już wyróżnić trzy główne kierunki rosyjskiej ofensywy: na Kijów z Białorusi z dużym udziałem wojsk aeromobilnych, z północnego wschodu na Charków i z Krymu na północ. Wydaje się, że na tym ostatnim kierunku Rosjanie mogą się pochwalić najszybszymi postępami. Trzeba jednak podkreślić, że nie oznaca to przerwania linii ukraińskich. To, czy jest się czym chwalić, zależy głównie od tego, jak Ukraińcy zaplanowali obronę na tym odcinku.

Aktualizacja (13.30): W kwestii starć rosyjskich i ukraińskich myśliwców. Poniższe nagranie, rzekomo pokazujące walkę manewrową MiG-a-29 i Su-27 lub Su-35, w rzeczywistości pokazuje parę ukraińskich MiG-ów-29. I teraz pytanie, na które nie mamy odpowiedzi: czy najpierw pojawiły się informacje o walkach powietrznych, a następnie błędnie dopasowano do nich filmik, czy też najpierw pojawił się filmik i na jego podstawie ktoś wymyślił informację o walkach powietrznych?

Aktualizacja (13.55): Rumuni pokazali zdjęcie Su-27, który wylądował w Bacău. Zweraca uwagę, że maszyna jest silnie uzbrojona – w pociski R-27 i R-73 – co dowodzi, że nie była to planowa ewakuacja na lotnisko zagraniczne. W takiej sytuacji wysłano by samolot nieuzbrojony, aby jak najszybciej i jak najkrótszą trasą dotarł do granicy państwa.

Ukraiński An-26 rozbił się lub został zestrzelony pod Kijowem. Na pokładzie znajdowało się czternaście osób. Potwierdzono, że pięć z nich straciło życie.







Aktualizacja (14.40): Siły zbrojne Ukrainy poinformowały, że z Białorusi w kierunku celów na Ukrainie odpalono cztery pociski balistyczne (zapewne systemu Iskander). Trweają walki na lotnisku w Hostomelu, a także w miastach Heniczesk, Skadowsk i Czapłynka. Te trzy miejscowości znajdują się w obwodzie chersońskim i są atakowane przez oddziały nacierające z Krymu na północ.

Aktualizacja (14.40): Korespondent CNN Matthew Chance informuje z Hostomelu, że Rosjanie zajęli lotnisko. Notabene stoi tam obecnie jedyny na świecie An-225 Mrija. Jego zniszczenie byłoby niepowetowaną stratą symboliczną – ta ogromna maszyna przez wiele lat była swoistym ambasadorem niepodległej niepodległej Ukrainy.

Aktualizacja (15.20): Siły zbrojne Ukrainy donoszą o ataku na Ostriw Zmijinyj, czyli Wyspę Węży – niewielki skrawek lądu na Morzu Czarnym w pobliżu granicy z Rumunią. W pobliżu wyspy znajdują się dwie jednostki rosyjskiej Floty Czarnomorskiej: krązownik Moskwa i okręt patrolowy projektu 22160 Wasilij Bykow, które użyły artylerii okrętowej przeciwko ukraińskiemu posterunkowi.







Rosyjskie pododdziały zaczęły przekraczać Antoniwśkyj mist (Most Antoniwski) na Dnieprze. Znajduje się on tuż obok Chersonia, sto kilometrów od Perekopu, stanowiącego de facto północną granicę Półwyspu Krymskiego.

Poniższe nagranie pokazujące MiG-a-29 ostrzeliwującego zabudowania cywilne lub cel w ich bezpośrednim sąsiedztwie za pomocą niekietowanych pocisków rakietowych rzeczywiście nie wymaga komentarza, ale zasługuje na to, aby oglądać je z włączonym dźwiękiem.

Aktualizacja (16.35): Według szacunków amerykańskiego Departamentu Obrony Rosjanie użyli do tej pory około siedemdziesięciu pięciu samolotów i bombowców. Zapewne należy pod tym określeniem rozumieć strategiczne nosiciele pocisków manewrujących Tu-160M, które mają zmienną (swing-wing), a nie stałą (fixed-wing) geometrię płata. Nie ma za to żadnych informacji o operacjach desantowych na wybrzeżu Morza Czarnego. Przewiduje się również, że Rosjanie będą próbowali zająć cały Kijów.

Ukraińcy informują, że pod Głuchowem, w pobliżu granicy z Rosją, w zasadzce znisxczono piętnaście czołgów T-72. Łatwo jednak zauważyć, że płonący pojazd na zdjęciu to bojowy wóz piechoty.







Aktualizacja (17.45): Ukrinform podaje, że niewielki garnizon na Wyspie Węży został zniszczony przez skoordynowany atak okrętów i bombowców frontowych Su-24. Normalnie na wyspie przebywa około stu osób, ale nie wszystkie są członkami sił zbrojnych. Los ocalałych obrońców jest na razie nieznany.

Aktualizacja (18.20): UNIAN ifnormuje, powołując się na kancelarię prezydenta, że Rosjanie po zaciętej walce zajęli Czarnobylską Elektrownię Jądrową. Stan zabezpieczeń przed skażeniem radioaktywnym nie jest obecnie znany.

Aktualizacja (19.15): UNIAN podał – powołując się na informacje Kancelarii Prezydenta Ukrainy – że rosyjscy żołnierze zajęli lotnisko w Hostomelu. Wcześniejsze informacje o jego opanowaniu okazały się prawdziwe. Walki toczyły się tam od popołudnia. W ścisłym związku z tą wiadomością pozostaje wpis na Twitterze Christa Grozewa z serwisu Bellingcat. Dziennikarz śledczy poinformował, że z Pskowa w Rosji w kierunku Kijowa wystartowało osiemnaście samolotów transportowych Ił-76. Wiozą one prawdopodobnie pododdziały elitarnej 76. Pskowskiej Dywizji Desantowo-Szturmowej, która swoje doświadczenie zbierała między innymi podczas konfliktu w Gruzji w 2008 roku. Pskowscy desantnicy przerzuceni zostali na Krym podczas eskalacji napięcia w kwietniu 2021 roku. Prawdopodobnym celem tej operacji będzie próba opanowania Kijowa (i ustanowienie marionetkowego rządu). Pod znakiem zapytania pozostaje, czy pierwsze próby rozpoczną się jeszcze dzisiejszej nocy.

Aktualizacja (20.50): Wbrew początkowym informacjom o odbiciu przez ukraińskie siły zbrojne lotniska Hostomel zacięte walki nadal trwają (Ołeksij Arestowycz, doradca w kancelarii prezydenta Ukrainy, informował nawet o przejęciu kontrolu przez ukraińskich żołnierzy, ale później wycofał się z tych doniesień). Ukraińcy nie chcą odpuścić, wiedzą, ile obiekt znaczy dla obrony Kijowa. Według ukraińskich źródeł dowódcy i żołnierze nie odpuszczają w obwodzie chersońskim. Szef tamtejszej Obwodowej Administracji Państwowej zaprzeczył informacjom o kapitalicji Chersonia i podkreślił, że Ukraińcy nadal toczą walki o Most Antoniwski na Dnieprze. Próba sił w tym miejscu trwa już ponad pięć godzin. W Sumach w północno-wschodniej części Ukrainy, nad rzeką Pseł, rosyjskie czołgi wjechały do miasta, ale tam miały napotkać gęsty ogień przeciwpancerny, który unieszkodliwił kilka z nich. Walki na Ukrainie trwają już ponad siedemnaście godzin, ministerstwo zdrowia podało, że zginęło 57 Ukraińców, a 169 zostało rannych.

Aktualizacja (21.40): Ministerstwo spraw wewnętrznych zdecydowało, że w obliczu bezpośredniego zagrożenia ukraińskiej stolicy cywilom wydawana będzie broń. Przez kilka godzin mieszkańcom przekazano 10 tysięcy jednostek broni.

Aktualizacja (22.00): Dobre wieści z Hostomelu. Ukraińskie ministerstwo obrony poinformowało, że udało się udaremnić główną operację desantową sił najeźdźczych. Nadal trwa walka o utrzymanie lotniska z pierwszym oddziałem uderzeniowym, który tam wylądował. Pojawiają się niepotwierdzone jeszcze informacje, że po ostatnim ukraińskim kontrataku wszyscy pozostali przy życiu Rosjanie wycofali się poza obręb lotniska. Krążą też pogłoski o zaczynającym się kontrataku w obwodzie chersońskim.

Aktualizacja (23.40): Były dobre wieści, są jeszcze lepsze. Na koniec niniejszego sprawozdania możemy potwierdzić, że Ukraińcy wygrali bitwę o lotnisko Hostomel i wyparli do lasu Rosjan z pierwszego desantu. Siły atakujące straciły prawdopodobnie sześć śmigłowców. Rosjanie oczywiście nie zrezygnują z zajęcia Hostomelu. Bez niego okrążenie i zdobycie Kijowa będzie dużo trudniejsze. Można więc w ciemno zakładać, że podejmą kolejną próbę, być może już tej nocy. Na razie jednak na kierunku północnym Rosjanie połamali sobie zęby. Największe sukcesy odnosi natarcie idące z Krymu na północ, które obeszło już Chersoń. To dopiero pierwszy dzień wojny.

Odnotujmy również, że znaleźli się dzielni Rosjanie, którzy mimo spodziewanej brutalności policji wyszli na ulice, aby protestować przeciwko wojnie. Manifestacje odbywają się w pięćdziesięciu pięciu miastach.

Będziemy kontynuować sprawozdania jutro. Spragnionych informacji na bieżąco niezmiennie zachęcamy do śledzenia na Twitterze: @RALee85, @ChristopherJM, @Archer83Able i @NeilPHauer.
