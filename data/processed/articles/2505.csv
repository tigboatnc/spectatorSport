Irpin (Ukraine) (AFP) – The last survivors in the ruins of Irpin have just one word to describe the Russians who have retreated after one of the pivotal battles of the war in Ukraine.

""Fascists!"" rages Bogdan, 58, as he and his friends walk a dog through a deserted town centre that is free of shelling for the first time in a month.

His friends nod in agreement.

""Every 20 to 30 seconds we heard mortar shots. And so all day long. Just destruction,"" the tent construction worker told AFP journalists who reached Irpin on Friday.

It used to be a smart commuter town in the pine forests on Kyiv's northwestern edge.

But Irpin held off the full force of Russia's invasion, becoming the closest Moscow's forces got to the centre of the capital some 20 kilometres (12 miles) away.

The town whose once leafy parks were left strewn with bodies is now back under Ukrainian control, as Russian troops hastily pull back from outside Kyiv.

Victory came at a terrible price that has left it looking more like Aleppo or Grozny than an affluent satellite town in Ukraine.

Barely a building has escaped the fighting unscathed. Shelling has blasted huge chunks out of modern, pastel-coloured apartment blocks.

The foggy streets are eerily empty, littered with cars with bullet-scarred windscreens, and echoing with the sound of stray dogs.

""It's the apocalypse,"" says a Ukrainian soldier who hitches a ride across the empty town.

'I love Irpin'

Irpin embodied the horrors of war in the early days of the invasion that Russian President Vladimir Putin said he launched to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine.

Images of a family wiped out by a shell as they tried to flee, and of thousands of people sheltering under a destroyed bridge, were seen around the world.

For the past three weeks it has been closed off to the media since the death of a US journalist, with Ukrainian authorities saying it was too dangerous to enter.

Now, near a sign in the town centre that says ""I love Irpin"" with a red heart, the handful of the town's residents who stayed tell how they survived more than a month of relentless shelling.

""We hid in the basement. They fired Grad rockets, mortars and tank shells,"" says Bogdan, asking to be identified only by his first name.

""My wife and I came under mortar fire twice. But that's okay, we are alive and well.""

Wandering through a street blocked by a burned-out cement mixer, resident Viktor Kucheruk begs for cigarettes.

""As soon as we hear a shot, we immediately scatter to our burrows,"" the 51-year-old says.

""The lamps in the chandeliers.. fell down from the explosions. We sat at home in the corner during the shelling, where the walls are the thickest.""

A new housing development with a large sign saying ""Irpin, Rich Town"" is pockmarked by shelling, with two apartments totally destroyed.

Playgrounds with abandoned children's scooters lie covered in rubble.

Rescue workers are still retrieving the dead from Irpin and placing them in body bags, before taking them to the blown-up bridge that links the town with Kyiv.

The bridge is covered with dozens of burned, bullet-ridden and abandoned cars, which rescue workers are now trying to clear.

Russian tank graveyard

Ukrainian forces have ""liberated"" a string of Russian-occupied towns and villages near the capital in recent days after Russia said it would scale back attacks on Kyiv.

Russia's pullback now appears to be gathering pace, even as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow was consolidating for an assault in the country's east and south.

AFP journalists counted at least 13 destroyed Russian armoured vehicles around the village of Dmytrivka, five kilometres (three miles) southwest of Irpin.

At least three charred corpses of Russian soldiers could be seen in the burned-out wreckage of a single wiped-out convoy of eight tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

A severed lower leg lay next to one vehicle.

Russian military uniforms and personal belongings lay scattered on the ground, including a red-leather bound Russian translation of Gibbon's ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"".

Villager Oksana Furman, 47, shows where Moscow's military might had left a shell hole in her kitchen during the tank battle two days ago.

A Russian tank had also reversed into her garden wall, causing it to collapse.

""There was a crazy rumble, the noise of the vehicles, everything was shaking. And then it was shell after shell,"" said Furman, who hid in a neighbour's basement.

Back in Irpin, where authorities say at least 200 civilians were killed, residents are keeping Ukraine's success in this battle in perspective.

""We recaptured Irpin, we recaptured a lot of things, but the war is not over,"" says Bogdan.

A few dozen people who had been living mostly in basements for a month staggered outside to collect food — bags of potatoes and bread — brought by Ukrainian soldiers.

Elena Shur, 43, an accountant for Ukraine’s national airline, said the first sign of the Ukrainian military came on Friday, when a civilian car carrying soldiers drove through town waving the country’s flag.

“We saw people on the street, and soldiers,” Ms. Shur said. “I cried.”

Reporters counted six bodies of civilians on the streets and sidewalks of Bucha. It was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head.

As photos of casualties in Bucha emerged, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Saturday that some of the dead wearing civilian clothes appeared to have been bound and executed.

“The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,” the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.” He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back. The New York Times was unable to independently verify Mr. Podolyak’s claim the people had been executed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv.html

Russian forces now appear to be focusing attacks in the east and south, a day after thousands of people from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol and surrounding Russian-held areas escaped in a convoy of buses and private cars organized by the Red Cross.

""Russia is prioritizing a different tactic: falling back on the east and south,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said on social media.

He said that, while Russian forces appeared to be pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv, their aim was to ""control a vast stretch of occupied territory and set up there in a powerful way.""

""Without heavy weapons we won't be able to drive (Russia) out,"" he said.

Ukraine has regained control of ""the whole Kyiv region"" after invading Russian forces retreated from some key towns, Deputy Defense Minister Ganna Maliar said on Saturday.

""Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader,"" Maliar said on Facebook, referring to towns that have been heavily destroyed by fighting. Irpin and Bucha, commuters towns outside Kyiv, were retaken by the Ukrainian army this week.

Hostomel, near Kyiv, was the setting of heavy fighting to take control of an airfield, while both Irpin and Bucha have suffered vast destruction and large civilian death tolls.

President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 and Ukraine estimates 20,000 people have been killed in the war so far. More than 10 million have had to flee their homes.

Zelenskyy warns of mines, traps laid by retreating Russians

As Russian forces pull back from Ukraine’s capital region, retreating troops are creating a ""catastrophic"" situation for civilians by leaving mines around homes, abandoned equipment and ""even the bodies of those killed,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Saturday.

Ukraine and its Western allies reported mounting evidence of Russia withdrawing its forces from around Kyiv and building its troop strength in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian fighters reclaimed several areas near the capital after forcing the Russians out or moving in after them, officials said.

The visible shift did not mean the country faced a reprieve from more than five weeks of war or that the more than 4 million refugees who have fled Ukraine will return soon. Zelenskyy said he expects departed towns to endure missile strikes and rocket strikes from afar and for the battle in the east to be intense.

""It’s still not possible to return to normal life, as it used to be, even at the territories that we are taking back after the fighting. We need wait until our land is demined, wait till we are able to assure you that there won’t be new shelling,” the president said during his nightly video address, though his claims about Russian mines couldn't be independently verified.

On the outskirts of Kyiv, signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of the Russian redeployment. Destroyed armored vehicles from both armies left in streets and fields and scattered military gear covered the ground next to an abandoned Russian tank.

Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Brovary, 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) east of the capital, Mayor Ihor Sapozhko said in a televised Friday night address. Shops were reopening and residents were returning but ""still stand ready to defend” their city, he added.

""Russian occupants have now left practically all of the Brovary district,” Sapozhko said. ""Tonight, (Ukrainian) armed forces will work to clear settlements of (remaining) occupants, military hardware and possibly from mines.”

Mass grave, civilian bodies in Bucha

Bucha's mayor said 280 people had been buried in a mass grave in Bucha and that the town is littered with corpses.

The bodies of at least 20 men in civilian clothes were found lying in a single street Saturday after Ukrainian forces retook the town of Bucha near Kyiv from Russian troops, Agence France-Presse (AFP) journalists said.

One of the bodies of the men had his hands tied, and the corpses were strewn over several hundred meters of the residential road in the suburban town northwest of the capital.

The cause of death was not immediately clear although at least one person had what appeared to be a large head wound.

Russian forces withdrew from several towns near Kyiv in recent days after Moscow's bid to encircle the capital failed, with Ukraine declaring that Bucha had been ""liberated.""

But the town had been left devastated by the fighting, with gaping holes from shell explosions in apartment blocks and crushed cars littering the streets, AFP journalists who accessed the town said.

Sixteen of the 20 corpses found on one street in Bucha were lying either on the pavement or by the verge. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road and another was lying in the courtyard of a house.

An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to the person who had his hands tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth.

All were wearing civilian clothes – winter coats, jackets or tracksuit tops, jeans or jogging bottoms and trainers or boots.

Two of them lay near bicycles while another was next to an abandoned car. Some lay face up, with their limbs askew, while others were lying face down.

The skin on the faces of the dead people had taken on a pale waxy appearance, indicating that they may have been there for at least a number of days.

The Ukrainian soldiers, backed by a column of tanks and armored vehicles, attached cables to the bodies and pulled them off the street, fearing they may be booby-trapped with explosive devices, the Associated Press (AP) reported.

As they moved on the streets of Bucha, the Ukrainian soldiers cleared barricades and inspected suspicious objects. They placed red rags on remnants of unexploded ordnance to draw attention to the possibility of explosions.

Residents of the town said the civilians were killed by Russian soldiers without apparent provocation.

""Those people were just walking and they shot them without any reason. Bang,"" said a Bucha resident who declined to give his name, citing safety reasons. ""In the next neighbourhood, Stekolka, it was even worse. They would shoot without asking any question.""

Authorities have said that at least 200 people have been killed in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.

Journalist Levin found dead near Kyiv

In Kyiv, the government confirmed that the body of a well-known photographer, Maks Levin, had been found near a village in the region around the capital that had been caught up in the fighting.

""According to preliminary information, unarmed Maxim Levin was killed by servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces with two shots from small fire arms,"" prosecutors said in a statement on Telegram.

Levin, a 40-year-old father of four, had been reported missing on March 13 and the body was found near Huta Mezhyhirska on April 1, officials said.

The NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said six journalists have been killed in the conflict so far, adding: ""Targeting journalists is a war crime.""

Moscow’s focus on eastern Ukraine also kept the besieged southern city of Mariupol in the crosshairs. The port city on the Sea of Azoz is located in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years. Military analysts think Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to capture the region after his forces failed to secure Kyiv and other major cities.

The International Committee of the Red Cross planned to try Saturday to get into Mariupol to evacuate residents. The Red Cross said it could not carry out the operation Friday because it did not receive assurances the route was safe. City authorities said the Russians blocked access to the city.

The humanitarian group said a team with three vehicles and nine Red Cross staff members was headed to Mariupol on Saturday to help facilitate the safe evacuation of civilians. It said its team planned to accompany a convoy of civilians from Mariupol to another city.

“Our presence will put a humanitarian marker on this planned movement of people, giving the convoy additional protection and reminding all sides of the civilian, humanitarian nature of the operation,” it said in a statement.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said 765 Mariupol residents reached Zaporizhzhia on Saturday in private vehicles.

The Mariupol city council said earlier Saturday that 10 empty buses were headed to Berdyansk, a city 84 kilometers (52.2 miles) west of Mariupol, to pick up people who managed to get there on their own. About 2,000 made it out of Mariupol on Friday, some on buses and some in their own vehicles, city officials said.

Evacuees boarded about 25 buses in Berdyansk and arrived around midnight to Zaporizhzhia, a city still under Ukrainian control that has served as the destination under previous cease-fires announced — and then broken — to get civilians out and aid into Mariupol.

Among them was Tamila Mazurenko, who said she fled Mariupol on Monday and made it to Berdyansk that night. Mazurenko said she waited for a bus until Friday, spending one night sleeping in a field.

“I have only one question: Why?” she said of her city’s ordeal. “We only lived as normal people. And our normal life was destroyed. And we lost everything. I don’t have any job, I can’t find my son.”

Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces a month ago, has suffered some of the war’s worst attacks, including on a maternity hospital and a theater that was sheltering civilians. Around 100,000 people are believed to remain in the city, down from a prewar population of 430,000, and they are facing dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine.

The city’s capture would give Moscow an unbroken land bridge from Russia to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. But its resistance has also has taken on symbolic significance during Russia’s invasion, said Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Ukrainian think-tank Penta.

“Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, and without its conquest, Putin cannot sit down at the negotiating table,” Fesenko said.

An adviser to Zelenskyy, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in an interview with Russian lawyer and activist Mark Feygin that Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement to allow 45 buses to drive to Mariupol to evacuate residents “in coming days.”

About 500 refugees from eastern Ukraine, including 99 children and 12 people with disabilities, arrived in the Russian city of Kazan by train overnight. Asked if he saw a chance to return home, Mariupol resident Artur Kirillov answered, “That’s unlikely, there is no city anymore.”

On the outskirts of Kyiv, signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of the Russian redeployment. Destroyed armored vehicles from both armies left in streets and fields and scattered military gear covered the ground next to an abandoned Russian tank.

Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Brovary, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) east of the capital, Mayor Ihor Sapozhko said Friday night. Shops were reopening and residents were returning but “still stand ready to defend” their city, he added.

A prominent Ukrainian photojournalist who went missing last month in a combat zone near the capital was found dead Friday in the Huta Mezhyhirska village north of Kyiv, the country’s prosecutor general’s office announced. Maks Levin, 40, worked as a photojournalist and videographer for many Ukrainian and international publications.

The prosecutor general’s office attributed his death to two gunshots allegedly fired by the Russian military, and it said an investigation was underway.

Elsewhere, at least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired late Friday at the Odesa region on the Black Sea, regional leader Maksim Marchenko said. The Ukrainian military said the Iskander missiles did not hit the critical infrastructure they targeted in Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port and the headquarters of its navy.

Ukraine’s state nuclear agency reported a series of blasts Saturday that injured four people in Enerhodar, a city in southeastern Ukraine that has been under Russian control since early March along with the nearby Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman said on Telegram that the four were badly burned when Russian troops fired light and noise grenades and mortars at a pro-Ukraine demonstration.

There was no immediate word Saturday on the latest round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, which took place Friday by video. During a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon a bid to join NATO and declare itself neutral — Moscow’s chief demand — in return for security guarantees from several other countries.

On Friday, the Kremlin accused Ukraine of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil.

Ukraine denied responsibility for the fiery blast at the civilian oil storage facility on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the Ukraine border. If Moscow’s claim is confirmed, it would be the war’s first known attack in which Ukrainian aircraft penetrated Russian airspace.

BUCHA, Ukraine, April 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine on Sunday accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow.

Russia's defence ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations, saying footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha were ""yet another provocation"" by the Ukrainian government.

The images from the town, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv's city centre, emerged after Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had reclaimed control of the whole Kyiv region and liberated towns from Russian troops.

They prompted outrage in Ukraine and abroad, adding to pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by increasing the likelihood of further Western sanctions. Western nations have already sought to isolate Russia economically and punish it for the invasion, which began on Feb. 24.

""Bucha massacre was deliberate,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images as ""a punch in the gut,"" while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Russia must pay for ""war crimes."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would step up sanctions, as well as military and humanitarian support for Ukraine.

""Putin and his supporters will feel the consequences,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, adding that Western allies would agree on further sanctions in the coming days.

Germany's defence minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union must discuss banning the import of Russian gas - a departure from Berlin's prior resistance to the idea of an embargo on Russian energy imports.

Russia requested that the U.N. Security Council convene on Monday to discuss what Moscow called a ""provocation by Ukrainian radicals"" in Bucha.

The defence ministry in Moscow described photos and videos from the town as a ""staged performance.""

Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and has rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising and ""denazifying"" Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation.

On Saturday, Reuters saw bodies in a mass grave and still lying on the streets, while on Sunday the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, showed reporters two corpses with white cloth tied around their arms, one of which appeared to have been shot in the mouth.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian troops had found the bodies of women who had been raped and set alight as well as the bodies of local officials and children.

Bucha's mayor said 300 residents had been killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army.

Reuters could not immediately verify the allegations by Arestovych and Fedoruk.

Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of what he called Russian war crimes, while the foreign ministers of France and Britain said their countries would support any such probe.

However, legal experts say a prosecution of Putin or other Russian leaders would face high hurdles and could take years.

Human Rights Watch said it had documented ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.

Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said prosecutors investigating possible war crimes by Russia had found 410 bodies in towns near Kyiv, of which 140 had been examined.

FIGHTING IN SEVERAL AREAS

Russia has pulled back forces that had threatened Kyiv from the north, saying it intends to focus on eastern Ukraine.

Fighting was reported on Sunday in several parts of Ukraine.

The governor of the eastern Donetsk region said shelling had continued throughout the night and day. Russian shelling killed seven people in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, according to the regional prosecutor's office.

Missiles struck near the southern port of Odesa, with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery used by the Ukrainian military. The Odesa city council said ""critical infrastructure facilities"" were hit.

Dmytro Lunin, governor of the central Poltava region, said the Kremenchug oil refinery, 350 km (220 miles) northeast of Odesa, had been destroyed in a separate rocket attack on Saturday.

Two blasts were heard in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine on Sunday, two witnesses told Reuters, days after Russian authorities accused Ukrainian forces of striking a fuel depot there.

Ukraine evacuated 2,694 people from conflict zones in the southeastern port of Mariupol and the region of Luhansk on Sunday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Ukrainian officials were in talks with Russia to allow several Red Cross buses to enter Mariupol, she added.

The Red Cross abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the charity for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with scant access to food and water.

There was little sign of a breakthrough in efforts to negotiate an end to the war, although Russia's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks were due to resume on Monday via videoconference.

Medinsky said that while Ukraine was showing more realism by agreeing to be neutral, renouncing nuclear weapons, not joining a military bloc and refusing to host military bases, there had been no progress on other key Russia demands.

""I repeat again and again: Russia's position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED,"" he said on Telegram.

Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has recognised declarations of independence by the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv's rule.

Ukraine's troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched its invasion.

At Bucha, a town neighboring Irpin, just 37 km (23 miles) northwest of the capital, Reuters journalists saw bodies lying in the streets, and the hands and feet of multiple corpses poking out of a still open grave at a church ground.

Israel's ambassador to Ukraine, Michael Brodsky, said Sunday that he was ""Deeply shocked by the photos from Bucha. Killing of civilians is a war crime and cannot be justified.""

A report issued Sunday by Human Rights Watch documents several cases of summary execution by Russian forces in Bucha and other localities in the Irpin area.

On March 4 in Bucha, ""soldiers forced five men to kneel on the side of the road, pulled their T-shirts over their heads, and shot one of the men in the back of the head,"" the report states.

Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said that ""the cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians. Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.""

'Kyiv is liberated'

After five weeks of fighting, Russia has pulled back forces that had threatened Kyiv from the north to regroup for battles in eastern Ukraine.

""The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,"" Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar wrote on Facebook. There was no Russian comment on the claim, which Reuters could not immediately verify.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" He did not cite evidence.

Locals said the dead in Bucha were civilians killed by departing Russian soldiers without provocation. President Zelenskyy warned residents that Russian forces were creating a “catastrophic” situation for civilians by leaving mines around homes, abandoned equipment and even corpses. Anti-tank mines were scattered across a bridge in Bucha.

In Irpin, crosses honoring the civilians killed during fighting mark a mass grave in the forest.

Ukraine's emergencies service said over 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital. Russia's defense ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the mining allegations. Reuters could not independently verify them.

Moscow denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations. But in Bucha, Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said more than 300 residents had been killed. Many residents tearfully recalled brushes with death and cursed the departed Russians.

""The bastards!"" Vasily, a grizzled 66-year-old man said, weeping with rage as he looked at more than a dozen bodies lying in the road outside his house. ""I’m sorry. The tank behind me was shooting. Dogs!""

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court's inquiry into potential war crimes.

Since the launch on Feb. 24 of what President Vladimir Putin called a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine, Russia has failed to capture a single major city and has instead laid siege to urban areas, uprooting a quarter of the country's population.

Russia has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. Ukraine and its allies say Russia was forced to shift its focus to east Ukraine after suffering heavy losses.

A new round of talks has not yet been announced. But Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on Saturday that enough progress had been made to allow direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy.

""The Russian side confirmed our thesis that the draft documents have been sufficiently developed to allow direct consultations between the two countries' leaders,"" Arakhamia said. Russia has not commented on the possibility.

Among those killed near Kyiv was Maksim Levin, a Ukrainian photographer and videographer who was working for a news website and was a long-time contributor to Reuters.

His body was found in a village north of Kyiv on April 1, the news website LB.ua where he worked said on Saturday.

In the east, the Red Cross was hoping a convoy to evacuate civilians would reach the besieged port of Mariupol on Sunday, having abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the ICRC for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there are trapped with scant access to food and water.

Ukraine's armed forces reported diminished Russian air and missile strikes, though in the early hours of Sunday missiles struck the southern port city of Odesa, the city council said.

Russia's defense ministry said its missiles had disabled military airfields in Poltava, in central Ukraine, and Dnipro, further south. It later said its forces had hit 28 Ukrainian military facilities across the country, including two weapons depots.

The Ukrainian military also reported Russian air strikes on the cities of Severodonetsk and Rubizhne in Luhansk, one of two southeastern regions where pro-Russian separatists declared breakaway states days before the invasion. The Ukrainian military said it had repulsed six enemy attacks in Luhansk and Donetsk, the other breakaway region, on Saturday.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/retreating-russian-forces-leave-behind-mass-graves-around-ukraine-s-capital-1.10715837
