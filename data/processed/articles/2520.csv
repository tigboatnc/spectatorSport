According to Vladimir Medinsky, assistant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the second round of negotiations will take place on March 3 in Belarus, close to the Polish border.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has confirmed that peace talks with Russia are on today, March 3.

A member of the Ukrainian delegation, lawmaker David Arakhamia, said that Ukraine is looking to at least agree on humanitarian corridors.

Apparently, during the United Nations General Assembly voting yesterday, many countries condemned the Russian, Ukraine war.

Meanwhile, President Hakainde Hichilema yesterday voted condemning Russian fight with Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to rebuild Ukraine after the war. He said on Thursday that Russia will ""reimburse"" Ukraine for everything they did against the country.

The Ukrainian President added, ""We have survived two world wars, three famines, the Holocaust, Babyn Yar, the Great Purge, the Chornobyl explosion, the occupation of Crimea, and the war in the east of our state.

""They [Russia] wanted to destroy us so many times, but they couldn't. We've been through so much. And if someone thinks that after overcoming all this, Ukrainians, all of us, will be scared, broken, or surrender, he just doesn't know anything about us. He [Putin] knows nothing about Ukraine.""

Russian troops launched an invasion of Ukraine on February 24 under the garb of ""special military operations"".

Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia announced the news in a Facebook post on Saturday, without providing further details. The Russian side was less definitive, saying merely that the talks might start on Monday.

Delegations from Ukraine and Russia have held two rounds of talks since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour on February 24.

On Thursday, the sides agreed to open humanitarian corridors to allow civilians out of some combat zones, although there have been delays in implementing them after Ukraine accused Russia of not upholding the ceasefire.

Ukraine said on Saturday the talks had not produced results but that it would keep pursuing negotiations.

Meanwhile, Israel's premier stepped into the role of mediator Saturday as Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensified, holding a three-hour meeting at the Kremlin with Vladimir Putin before calling Ukraine's president and flying to Berlin.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's sit-down with Putin was the first by foreign leader since the day Russian forces invaded Ukraine last week, and came after Kyiv had asked Israel to launch a dialogue with Moscow.

Russia and Ukraine will hold a third round of talks on Monday about ending hostilities, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said in a Facebook post on Saturday, without providing further details. Pictured: The two sides hold a second round of talks on Thursday

'The third round of talks will take place on Monday,' Arakhamia, who is also the parliamentary faction leader of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's party, wrote.

Russian news agency Interfax later quoted Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky as saying 'the third round really could take place in the coming days, it's possible it will be on Monday.'

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that Zelenskiy's attempt to secure direct NATO help in the conflict between their countries was not helping talks between the two sides, but that Moscow was ready for a third round.

Wary of being dragged into Moscow's war on its neighbor, NATO on Friday turned down Zelenskiy's appeal to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

This prompted the Ukrainian president to say that the alliance had given Russia the green light to continue its bombing campaign.

Earlier on Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he was open to talks with Lavrov, but only if they were 'meaningful.'

The Kremlin said on Friday that progress in the negotiations would depend on Kyiv's reaction to Moscow's position on how to end the war, which had been conveyed to Ukraine on Thursday.

Russia's TASS news agency quoted Slutsky as saying the Ukrainian side had shown some openness in the second round to reaching an agreement.

News of the third round of talks came as Britain said Russia's proposed ceasefire in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol was probably an attempt to deflect international condemnation while giving itself a chance to reset its forces for a renewed offensive.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia's proposed ceasefire in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Saturday was 'likely an attempt to deflect international condemnation while resetting its force for renewed offensive activity'.

In an intelligence update on Saturday afternoon, the MoD said: 'By accusing Ukraine of breaking the agreement, Russia is likely seeking to shift responsibility for current and future civilian casualties in the city.'

Russia said earlier it had opened humanitarian corridors near the besieged cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha. Russia's defence ministry then accused Ukrainian 'nationalists' of preventing civilians from leaving, RIA news agency reported.

But Mariupol's city council said Russia was not observing the ceasefire.

Also today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western sanctions were akin to war as his forces pressed their assault on Ukraine on Saturday for a 10th day and the IMF warned that the conflict would have a 'severe impact' on the global economy.

Moscow and Kyiv traded blame over the failure of plans to impose a brief ceasefire and enable civilians to evacuate two cities besieged by Russian forces.

Russia's invasion has already driven nearly 1.5 million refugees westwards into the European Union.

Putin said he wanted a neutral Ukraine that had been 'demilitarised' and 'denazified', adding: 'These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war but thank God it has not come to that.'

Ukraine and Western countries have rejected Putin's arguments as a baseless pretext for invading and have sought to squeeze Russia hard with sanctions.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said planned civilian evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha were now unlikely to start on Saturday.

The city council in Mariupol had accused Russia of not observing a ceasefire, while Moscow said Ukrainian 'nationalists' were preventing civilians from leaving.

Britain said the proposed ceasefire in Mariupol - which has been without power, water and heating for days - was likely an attempt by Russia to deflect international condemnation while it resets its forces.

The port of Mariupol has endured heavy bombardment, a sign of its strategic value to Moscow due to its position between Russian-backed separatist-held eastern Ukraine and the Black Sea Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Kyiv in 2014.

Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces were carrying out a wide-ranging offensive in Ukraine and had taken several towns and villages, Interfax news agency reported.

Russia is continuing to advance in southern Ukraine, with Mariupol under bombardment and Odessa and Mykolaiv under threat. Chernihiv, in the north, and Kharkiv, in the east, continue to come under heavy bombardment. The capital Kyiv is also under threat, though Ukrainian counter-attacks took out some Russian forces early on Friday

In an aerial combat near Zhytomyr, about 100 km (62 miles) west of Kyiv, it said, four Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jets had been shot down. Reuters could not independently confirm the report.

A United Nations monitoring mission said at least 351 civilians had been confirmed killed and 707 injured in Ukraine so far since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, adding that the real figures were likely to be 'considerably higher'.

The number of refugees could rise to 1.5 million by Sunday night from 1.3 million now, the U.N. refugee agency chief said.

Women and children, often numb with exhaustion, continued to pour into Poland and other neighbouring countries as well as into western Ukrainian cities such as Lviv.

'I've barely slept for 10 days,' said Anna Filatova, arriving in Lviv with her two daughters from heavily bombed Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city near its eastern border with Russia.

'The Russians want to flatten Kharkiv... We hate Putin.'

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a visit to Poland, met refugees staying in a disused shopping mall near the border. Poland has taken in the vast majority of the Ukrainian refugees.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's sit-down with Putin was the first by foreign leader since the day Russian forces invaded Ukraine last week, and came after Kyiv had asked Israel to launch a dialogue with Moscow.

Bennett has so far walked a very cautious line on the Ukraine crisis, seeking to preserve delicate security cooperation with Russia, which has a large military presence in Israel's northern neighbour, Syria.

Bennett has not joined Western leaders - notably key ally the United States - in forcefully condemning the invasion, instead stressing Israel's strong relations with both Russia and Ukraine.

Ahead of his Moscow trip, Bennett had spoken by telephone repeatedly with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Bennett's office said he left Israel for Moscow early Saturday, itself an extraordinary move for a religious Jew who does not conduct state business on the Jewish Shabbath, except in extraordinary circumstances.

Bennett and Putin met for three hours, in a visit that was coordinated with the US, Germany and France, an Israeli official said.

Bennett's delegation included his housing minister, fluent Russian speaker Zeev Elkin, who was born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union.

The Kremlin said 'different aspects of the situation in Ukraine' were discussed during 'the short working visit'.

After the Putin meeting, Bennett called Zelensky - who is Jewish, has family in Israel and has visited the country many times.

Bennett then headed to Germany for talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz scheduled for late Saturday.

A statement from the French presidency said Emmanuel Macron also spoke to Bennett before he left for Moscow on Saturday, as part of joint efforts to 'obtain a ceasefire in Ukraine'.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10581425/Russia-Ukraine-hold-round-peace-talks-Monday-Kyiv-claims.html

The White House has asked lawmakers to approve $10 billion in lethal and humanitarian aid for Ukraine as part of a $32.5 billion emergency funding request sent to Capitol Hill as Russia continues its advance on Ukraine.

The request follows weeks of discussions between White House officials and lawmaker about the shape of any potential emergency request, which was expected to focus heavily on Covid-19 needs. But the escalating Russian invasion has dramatically increased the size of the request for Ukraine specifically.

Lawmakers are in the midst of negotiations over a long-term funding deal and face a March 11 deadline to reach an agreement.

The Ukraine funds are expected to be attached to any final deal, but the process remains fluid.

“This request identifies an immediate need for $10.0 billion in additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance for Ukraine and Central European partners due to Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion,” the formal request sent Wednesday from acting Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young to Congressional leadership says.

Young suggested the initial $10 billion request for Ukraine would address “immediate needs” and more funding could be needed.

“Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, I anticipate that additional needs may arise over time. This funding request is based on the Administration’s best information on resource requirements at this time, and we will remain in touch with the Congress in the coming weeks and months as we assess resource requirements beyond these immediate needs,” she said.

More on the funding request: The detailed request provides $4.8 billion to the Department of Defense, including $1.8 billion for support in the region as US military units support the US European Command and NATO Response Force, $1.3 billion for cybersecurity and other defense support, and $1.8 billion for replenishment of DOD stocks. It also calls for $5 billion for the Department of State and US Agency for International Development (USAID), including $2.8 billion in humanitarian assistance like food and other support, $500 million in military assistance through the Foreign Military Financing program, and $1.8 billion in economic assistance to help “support continuity of government and the resilience of the Ukrainian people, as well as emergent needs in the region.”

The request also provides $21 million for the Department of Commerce to bolster export controls, $30 million for the Department of Energy to provide “technical assistance for electric grid integration,” $59 million for the Department of Justice to support a newly-announced Task Force KleptoCapture to enforce sanctions on Russia and other funding for the Multinational Task Force, and $91 million for the Department of Treasury for sanctions support and IRS criminal investigations, among other expenditures.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-03-22/h_2ceee7e3299df1b5c3e53cfa4ad41f1d

The flight, which will reach Moldova via Romania, will also transport a 40-strong team of medical personnel who will join a group of volunteers the organization sent earlier this week to work at three field hospitals the rescue organization is setting up at Moldova’s Ukraine border for people fleeing Russia’s invasion.

The team is made up of EMTs, paramedics and doctors, as well as members of the organization’s Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit, which provides aid in the field for people who are undergoing trauma. Many of medics expect to be deployed for around two weeks, but the fast-moving crisis means that many could be away from home for longer.

Much of the aid on the plane is medical equipment for the field hospitals, but there is also food, warm clothing, blankets, heat pads, diapers, formula and feminine hygiene products – many of the supplies have been donated by a number of Israeli companies.

In a move that distinguishes the team from other aid organizations, they are also transporting two Torah scrolls for religious members of their teams on the ground.

The plane will return to Israel later in the day carrying some 150 refugees with Israeli citizenship back to Israel.

“The complexity of this operation is immense. It involves travel permits, diplomatic relations, and travel between three countries by land and by air,” says Eli Beer, president of United Hatzalah.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international body’s refugee agency, said Wednesday that over 1 million people are now refugees as a result of the fighting in Ukraine, with concerns that figure will keep climbing. There were 44 million Ukrainians on the eve of the invasion.

Refugees are crossing the borders from Ukraine into neighboring countries to the west — Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.

The airlift is the latest in a number of deliveries sent from Israel this week to Ukraine and its neighboring countries to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis there.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-3-2022/

“On our way to negotiations with the Russian Federation. Already in helicopters,” presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter.

Podolyak posted a photo of himself with lawmaker David Arakhamia dressed in military uniform in what appears to be a helicopter cabin.

Arakhamia said on Facebook that Ukraine wants to negotiate humanitarian corridors with Russia.

“We start in two hours,” he wrote at around 1200 GMT.

Russia’s delegation — led by President Vladimir Putin’s aide Vladmir Medinsky — said its proposals have to do with “military-technical, humanitarian-international and political” aspects.

According to Belarus and Russia, the talks will take place in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha in Belarus’s Brest region close to the border with Poland.

A first round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations took place earlier this week on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, but brought no results.

Ukraine demands an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces.

Russia has not specified its demands, but says it wants “the demilitarisation and denazification” of its pro-Western neighbour.
