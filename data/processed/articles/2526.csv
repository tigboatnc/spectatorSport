Russian forces have been facing stiff resistance since the day it entered Ukraine more than a month ago. Since Russian forces were numerically superior and had sophisticated weapons, many thought the war will be over within a few days.

But that was not the case. The resistance against Russians kept getting stiffer as they marched towards capital Kyiv, which caused them to lose a lot of weapons and armoury.

Among them are tanks, which Russians have lost in a large number.

How many Russian tanks have been destroyed?

According to information released by Ukrainian armed forces on social media, Russia has lost more than 680 tanks.

Oryx, a military and intelligence blog which keeps a count of Russia's military losses in Ukraine based on photos from the warzone, says the Russian military has lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and 460 tanks.

American think tank Rand Corporation, along with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said in a release that Russia had more than 2,700 tanks before the Ukraine war began.

How has Ukraine been able to destroy so many Russian tanks?

A major part of the success came due to the weapons provided by the western countries, including the United States. The US supplied Ukraine with 2,000 anti-tank Javelin missiles when the conflict began and later sent 2,000 more.

The lightweight but lethal weapon has allowed the soldiers in Ukraine to inflict some serious damage to Russian tanks and artillery.

According to Lockheed Martin, the missile automatically guides itself to the target after launch (“fire and forget” system), allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire, or load a new missile.

It also has a gentler start, making it difficult for the enemy to see where it was launched from.

The Javelins explode at the top of the tank, where the armour is believed to be the weakest.

Apart from the US, the United Kingdom has sent NLAWs and Starstreak missiles, which has also helped the Ukrainians destroy Russian drones.

The US is now supplying 100 Switchblade anti-tank drones to Ukraine, the BBC reported.

Is this a fault of Russian tactics?

Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, told the BBC, “Some of those tanks were abandoned because they ran out of fuel. That's a logistical failure. Some got stuck in the spring-time mud, because the high command invaded at the wrong time of year.”

""Many tanks have been abandoned because of bad driving. Some have been driven off bridges. Others have been driven into ditches so that the tracks have come off. The ability of the troops to use their equipment has been lacking,” said Nick Reynolds, who works at think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).

Moreover, the Ukrainian government itself has been issuing instructions about how to destroy Russian tanks, which is being used by civilians who are taking part in the war.

According to Oryx report, half of the tanks that Russia lost were not destroyed or damaged by the enemy but captured or abandoned.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-war-heres-why-russia-has-lost-so-many-tanks-2880939

“The Department of the Defense recently established a deconfliction line with the Russian Ministry of Defense on March 1 for the purposes of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation,” a senior US defense official said in a statement. “The United States retains a number of channels to discuss critical security issues with the Russians during a contingency or emergency.”

The communications line is basically an exchange of phone numbers between both sides for quick access. The US side will be run out of the US European Command’s operations center in Stuttgart, Germany, while the Russian side is expected to be coordinated out of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, a second senior defense official said.

The US had wanted a communications channel because US and Russian troops are now operating on the so-called eastern flank close to Ukraine and Belarus airspace where Russian forces are staging and attacking.

The second official did not know what events would specifically trigger a phone call on either side, but the overall idea is to ensure “we can reduce the risk of miscalculation and potential misunderstanding” given the potential proximity of forces. It was also not immediately clear to what extent NATO aircraft would be included in the agreement. It is also unclear if US and Russian ships are included.

Air operations are particularly concerned because of the high speed and relatively short distances at which encounters could occur given Russian aircraft are operating close to the areas where US troops are in Poland, Romania and the Baltic nations.

The establishment of the agreement is particularly noteworthy because until now Pentagon officials have said they have not had any direct communications with Russian counterparts since the invasion.

There had been an effort to establish the communications line since late last month. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last spoke with Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu on Feb.18. The two also spoke one week earlier. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley last spoke to the Chief of Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov on Feb. 11.

The US has specifically rejected a no-fly zone over Ukraine saying it would put US pilots into a combat scenario in order to enforce such a plan. But the door is not shut on a potential future air humanitarian corridor to guarantee safe flight of relief supplies hostilities cease, officials say.

More back ground: A deconfliction protocol has existed for several years between US and Russian forces in Syria. For the most part it has worked, although US officials have complained on several occasions the Russians have not given enough advance warning of their operations. The US does not give Russia detailed information but did notify them recently when US aircraft would be operating in a broad area northeast Syria.

NBC News first reported the establishment of the deconfliction channel.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-03-22/h_91f5614af4ffc6e9b868cdc3423c1d34

Reports surfacing from Ukraine say that a Ukrainian sniper has killed a high ranking Russian officer in the city of Hostomel to the North of Kyiv. The reports surfaced in both Ukrainian and Russian social media and appear to be authentic. Russian media outlet Pravda acknowledged the news on Mar. 3, 2022.

Russian Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division in Novorossiysk for three years and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army.

Sukhovetsky was 47 years old and a “highly decorated veteran” who was appointed deputy army commander of the 41st division in October 2021. Maj. Gen. Sukhovetsky had completed combat deployments in the Chechen war, Abkhazia, and the intervention in Syria. He had participated in the traditional Russian Victory Day Parade in Moscow twice and also been awarded a special commendation for his participation in Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

The loss of a high-ranking general officer for the Russians is significant. And while this information originated from Ukrainian sources, Russian social media has corroborated the story before western sources confirmed them.

The news comes as reports suggest fierce fighting on the ground north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where a long convoy of Russian vehicles has been seen for several days.

A report from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry claimed that Ukrainian forces destroyed 20 Russian military vehicles in the area surrounding the Hostomel Airport [that has become famous for being the homebase of the only An-225 Mryia, the world’s largest cargo plane, that was destroyed in the fightings] on Thursday. Ukrainian sources claimed the fighting around Hostomel was being conducted by a Ukrainian special forces unit supported by partisans fighting against the Russian incursion.

Additional reports said that the capital city of Kyiv was hit by a Russian short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) strike overnight. Reports said one missile hit the central train station, where crowds of Ukrainians attempting to flee the capital city had been seen days before. Three more ballistic missiles hit either TV or radio stations in Kyiv according to the Ukrainian reports.

Intelligence experts have suggested that Russia is using its only Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM) in service in Ukraine, the 9K720 Iskander-M mobile ballistic missile. The missile can deliver several different payloads including cluster munitions, high explosive and fuel-air explosives. One warhead that can be used on the Iskander-M produces an electromagnetic pulse to disable communications and radar capabilities.

The Iskander-M SRBM has a range of up to 500 kilometers with a minimum engagement range of 50 kilometers. It is specifically designed to evade anti-missile systems by flying a low trajectory where it is difficult to intercept.",https://theaviationist.com/2022/03/04/general-andrey-sukhovetsky-killed/

Residents in Kyiv have organised huge resistance efforts to deter the Russian invasion. On the ninth day of the conflict, FRANCE 24 joined the civilian and military forces who have sworn to defend the Ukrainian capital against Putin’s army.

Trellis fencing, combat boots, sleeping bags: Kostya Kravets throws anything he thinks might be useful into two large black sports bags. The 43-year-old accountant knows that his Territorial Defence unit needs anything and everything he can provide.

“The absolute priority at the moment is bullet-proof vests and helmets. We also need drones, walkie-talkies and diesel generators,“ Kravets tells FRANCE 24, before leaving for his base in Tarasivka in southwest Kyiv. Every minute counts in the fight to fortify the capital and surrounding areas.

He has barely left before others enter the ordinary-looking building in Kyiv, now transformed into a hive of resistance operations. Entire rooms have been set aside for storing medicine, water, clothes and electronics. Similar hubs have opened up around the capital since the start of the war. The sense of solidarity, the flood of donations and the dedication of volunteers contains echoes of Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution in 2014 – a series of violent protests that overthrew the country’s Russia-backed government.

Today, the juggernaut of the Russian military may be in close proximity, but it has not dented the spirit of the resistance.

'We are 100% ready'

“From a military perspective, we are 100% ready. The Russians are going to try and enter Kyiv, but they’re going to realise it’s impossible … They have swallowed their own propaganda and think the Ukrainians are going to welcome them with flowers,” says Serhiy Prytula, a politician and former actor who is running the logistics hub.

“The Russians still don’t understand where they are.”

Prytula, who became well known in Ukraine from TV shows such as The Voice, says there is a waiting list of “more than 1,500 people” for a bullet-proof vest. An international effort to transport large quantities of ballistic protection and other equipment from Poland via Lviv has been set up.

Efforts among volunteers mean that the Territorial Defence Forces – the second front of the resistance in Kyiv – have been provided with equipment. The civil reserve forces received arms as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine.

“We need the Territorial Defence Force so that the army can concentrate on combat operations. The whole country is now part of territorial defence,” says Prytula.

The reserve fighters, who wear yellow arm bands, have become omnipresent in the streets of Kyiv. They can be found in large numbers in the northern quarters of the capital, where Russian reconnaissance fighters launched their first attacks at the start of the conflict.

Inexperienced but motivated

“Our objective is to carry out vehicle checks, verify documents, search for saboteurs, enforce the curfew and prevent looting,” says Oleg, a neighbourhood supervisor with the Territorial Defence in northern Kyiv. The 50-year-old business man has the air of a typical new recruit: inexperienced but motivated. He was overseas when Russia invaded Ukraine, but quickly returned to Kyiv by car to defend his country.

“We have seen how the Russian world works. There is no choice, no elections, we have to obey someone chosen in Moscow,” he says. Oleg is originally from east Ukraine and spent one year living in administrative zones run by Luhansk separatists in Donbas.

“Ukraine is free. It is a place where we can speak freely and disagree … We didn’t want war, but now we have no choice. We have to fight.”

'We won’t stay at home'

This opinion is shared by a group in their 20s, who have come to help strengthen a checkpoint by digging trenches. The excavated earth is then shovelled into white bags and used to barricade positions held by members of the Territorial Defence.

“My uncle has already signed up. My boyfriend and I called, and have even been to the recruitment centre twice since the invasion started. We don’t want to stay at home, and we won’t stay at home,” says economics student Marina Mahdenko.

She celebrated her 23rd birthday on March 1, the same day that Russian strikes destroyed the television tower in Kyiv. As she lives nearby she heard the explosions, which killed five people. For her and her friends, there is no question of spending the rest of their lives in a state subjugated by Moscow.

'We want to be alongside the army'

This flood of volunteers joining the Territorial Defence Force has allowed more experienced fighters to take the fight forwards, knowing that someone is covering their backs.

“We want to be alongside the army, taking the offensive and killing invaders,” says one such fighter, 54-year-old Evgeniy Yarantsev.

He is stationed around 10 kilometres northeast of Oleg and Marina’s checkpoint, near to Hostomel Airport.

His troop has been engaged in relentless fighting at the strategic site since the first day of the invasion, when Russian paratroopers attempted a surprise attack.

“Of the 200 airborne troops that tried to capture the airport so that Russian planes could land here, two-thirds were killed and the rest are in position in nearby forests … We had good results in the first few days,” he says, smiling to reveal multiple gold teeth. Nonetheless, the veteran expects a long, hard war. Some in his troop have already been killed and injured; Yarantsev already has a slight injury to his left eye.

Those losses have done little to dampen morale among the soldiers, and this troop in particular shares a long and bloody history. Most met for the first time on the barricades during the Maidan Revolution before forming an autonomous troop to fight separatist, pro-Russian forces in Donbas.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reunited them to fight the biggest battle of their lives. To mark the occasion, Yarantsev baptised the group the “Conan Unit” after the 1982 film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan the Barbarian. Perhaps an omen of the epic battles to come.
