The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, will ask member nations next week to grant temporary asylum to all Ukrainians coming to the bloc for up to three years, the bloc’s commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, told reporters on Sunday. Member nations will have to agree, but Ms. Johansson said after a meeting of interior ministers on Sunday that “an overwhelming majority” was in favor.

Seven million Ukrainians are expected to be displaced as a consequence of the Russian invasion.

Ukrainians can stay visa-free in the European Union for up to 90 days, and they can move freely between member nations. According to the commission, many have already left the first country they arrived in and headed to countries with big Ukrainian diasporas, mainly the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain.

So far, a limited number of Ukrainians have applied for asylum, Ms. Johansson said, with most joining their relatives who already live in the European Union. “But things will change, and we need to be prepared for much higher number of people trying to come,” she added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/europe/european-union-ukrainian-refugees-asylum.html

During her visit to Romania, Johansson told Euronews, “This is really a situation where we could have millions of people on our territory, and then we need to make sure that they have the proper protection and that they have the proper rights,” adding, “Most of Ukrainians coming now, they are coming with passports that give them visa-free entry for 90 days. But we have to prepare for day 91.”

To this end, Johansson said the directive would help the European Union (EU) member states to handle the applications of all Ukrainian citizens expected to enter the bloc in the coming days. She noted that the mechanism could be adopted from Thursday.



The announcement comes after the EU’s interior ministers met on Sunday to discuss the bloc’s common response to the brewing migration crisis in Ukraine. The meeting was convened by French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, who said, “The European Union and its member states have provided, and will continue to provide, political, financial, humanitarian and logistical support in the face of Russian aggression.” Darmanin also activated the ‘EU’s Integrated Political Crisis Response’ mechanism to discuss aid allocation, monitor the situation, and coordinate solidarity efforts.

#JHA | EU home affairs ministers discussed the activation of the temporary protection system for Ukrainian refugees. They also discussed:



➡️humanitarian support

➡️management of external borders

➡️visa measures

➡️response in case of hybrid threats

During the meeting, Johansson extended support to the directive, saying, “In my view, I think it would be the right time to use the Temporary Protection Directive to give the proper protection to people fleeing, and also the possibility to move in the European Union.”



Commenting on the same, Sweden’s Minister for Integration, Anders Ygeman, said the directive is not a “magic wand” since it is voluntary. “I think to tackle this kind of situation we need binding rules in the EU… solidarity that is bound by real decisions,” he added.



The never-used-before mechanism was adopted following the 2001 wars in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. The directive extends temporary and immediate protection to people from non-EU countries who have been forced to leave their country due to armed conflict, violation of their human rights, and endemic violence. The directive strikes a balance between member states by allocating refugees according to states’ accommodation capacities.



Once the mechanism is activated, all EU member states, except Denmark and Ireland, are obligated to receive the displaced people and fulfil certain obligations, including the issuance of residence permits to those granted temporary protection, which can be extended for up to three years.



Reportedly, the activation of the ‘temporary protection directive’ will be proposed during the March 3 meeting of the EU member states’ interior and justice ministers.



According to the United Nations, more than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine and sought refuge in neighbouring countries such as Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Slovakia. The Commission estimates that Russia’s military attack on Ukraine could lead to Europe’s largest humanitarian crisis and displace seven million Ukrainians.



About half a million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began last week, according to the United Nations refugee agency.



About half of them crossed the western border to Poland. Others have gone to Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia.https://t.co/ktF9ultRmZ pic.twitter.com/mNzTg2PvWr — The New York Times (@nytimes) March 1, 2022

Poland has opened its borders for all Ukrainians and removed its negative COVID-19 test requirement. Germany and Austria are also offering free train services to those trying to flee the war.



Meanwhile, the European Commission on Monday announced additional emergency aid worth $100 million to aid civilians affected by the war in Ukraine. According to the official press release, the funding will help people in Ukraine and Moldova, and provide them with food, water, shelter, and health. Furthermore, the Commission said it is coordinating the transportation of material aid, including essential medical supplies, via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Ukraine.",https://www.statecraft.co.in/article/eu-activates-temporary-protection-directive-to-aid-over-500-000-ukrainians-fleeing-war

RUSSIAN MILITARY PRISIONERS IN UKRAINE

The Ukrainian Security Service (SSU) has shared, in recent hours, several videos of Russian prisoners who are filmed reporting the terror they experienced. Many are not much more than 20 years old and are asking their family to rally against Putin.

The board said in a statement that in cases where it proves impossible to prevent athletes from the two countries competing, such as if there is insufficient time to give notice or for other “organisational or legal reasons”, they should be prevented from doing so under their nations’ banner.

Russia has been expelled from the 2022 World Cup and its teams suspended from all international football competitions “until further notice” after its invasion of Ukraine, FIFA announced in a joint statement with UEFA on Monday. The men’s team had been due to play in qualifying play-offs in March for the World Cup in Qatar later this year, while its women’s side had qualified for the European Championship in England, to be held in July.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommends that Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials are banned from any organised international competitions.

The IOC has urged sport governing bodies not to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete, with the Beijing Winter Paralympic Games starting on Friday. (BBC)

TRANSPORT

The trains are free and everyone can enter up to the maximum limit. Even so, several families were being separated as only children and women could pass. The capital’s central train station is completely packed. This comes after the Russian Defence Ministry said civilians can safely leave Kyiv.

SANCTIONS

Switzerland, a traditionally neutral country, will adopt all European Union sanctions against Russia, “without any exception”, the government announced on Monday, after the president had given this possibility as “very likely”.

Ignazio Cassis admitted that this is an “unprecedented and difficult step” that needed “careful consideration”.

Finance Minister Ueli Maurer added that “there will not be a single exception” to European sanctions and that “it is essential” to maintain the integrity of the Swiss financial centre.

NETFIX AND SPOTIFY

Some Netflix and Spotify members in Russia say they are having trouble paying their subscription fees.

As SkyNews reports, some service users say they are receiving error messages related to their bank cards, especially from banks such as Sberbank, Tinkoff and Alfa-Bank.

It is possible that these difficulties are related to the exclusion of these banks from the SWIFT financial system but, for the moment, none of the companies has commented on the situation.

RUSSIAN BANKING

All Russian banks will have their assets frozen within days, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Monday, as part of plans to ramp up economic sanctions. “We will bring in a full asset freeze on all Russian banks in days, looking to coordinate with our allies,” Truss told parliament, saying it was designed to prevent the Kremlin funding its invasion of Ukraine.

Putin will pay ‘over the long run’ for Ukraine invasion, Biden says in State of the Union address

U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin must be harshly punished for the invasion of Ukraine to stop other authoritarians from emulating his attack on the democratic world, framing the war as an existential fight against autocracy.

“Throughout our history, we’ve learned this lesson: when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving, and the costs and threats to America and to the world keep rising.”

Mr. Biden emphasized the unity of the Western alliance in imposing unprecedented sanctions on Moscow, vowing that Mr. Putin would come out of the struggle far worse off. He also announced further measures, including that the U.S. would join the European Union and Canada in closing its airspace to Russian planes, and seize luxury yachts belonging to oligarchs.

He ruled out sending U.S. forces to Ukraine, an acknowledgment both of Americans’ refusal to get into another war after debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan, and of the risks of escalation. Mr. Putin has already threatened to use his nuclear arsenal in response to Western sanctions.

Analysis: In first State of the Union address, Biden captures the moment telling Putin ‘freedom will always triumph over tyranny’

The annual State of the Union Address is an American set-piece, a sturdy tradition required by the Constitution, and beginning with the 20th century, 87 of these messages have been delivered in person and most of them have concentrated on domestic affairs.

Not this one.

Not in a Capitol sealed off by a fence. Not in a capital warily watching the Russian invasion of Ukraine and shuddering as Vladimir Putin has his nuclear forces on alert.

“The world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security,” Joe Biden said, telling Ukrainians, represented in the hall by Oksana Markarova, Kyiv’s ambassador to Washington, “We stand with you.”

The principal elements of the speech were addressed as much to Mr. Putin as to the audience in the chamber and at home across the country.

“The free world is holding him accountable,” Mr. Biden said, adding that the Russian president was “more isolated from the world than he has ever been.”

Asian shares slip, oil surges again as Russia sanctions bite

Asian stocks came under renewed pressure and oil prices jumped after rising worries about the impact of aggressive sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine sank shares in Europe and on Wall Street.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes closed about 1.6% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1.8%.

Global sanctions against Russia have prompted a string of major companies to announce suspensions to or exits from their businesses in the country.

Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday that it will exit Russia operations, including oil production fields, following similar decisions by British oil giants BP PLC and Shell, and Norway’s Equinor ASA.

Exxon’s announcement comes as the price of oil continues to surge above $100 per barrel. On Wednesday morning, global benchmark Brent crude jumped 2.6% to $107.69 per barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 3% o $106.50.

Alberta investment agency to sell off Russian assets

Alberta’s public-investment manager Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMCo, says it has started divesting all of its small measure of Russian holdings in response to the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing humanitarian crisis.

The public-investment manager holds more than $160-billion in assets for provincial pension plans and endowments and said in a news release that the decision is “both values, and value-driven” and reflects the change in geopolitical risk.

At the end of last week, AIMCo’s exposure was about $159-million, or roughly 0.1 per cent of its total assets, according to the fund manager’s spokesperson Dénes Németh. But by this week, that number had dropped.

AIMCo’s news release also said the Russian holdings now represent 0.16 per cent of the entire $48.7-billion public-equities portfolio and areexternally managed. “Beyond public equities, AIMCo does not have any direct exposure to Russia.”

Former Afghan translator flees Ukraine to safety

From inside a Polish school near the border with Ukraine that’s been converted to a shelter for refugees, Jawed Haqmal says he can’t believe what his family experienced over the past five days in Kyiv and he’s feeling incredibly relieved to have made it to safety.

“Finally I escaped that country, this is the second war. I hope there will not be a third,” Mr. Haqmal told The Globe and Mail on Tuesday evening after the nearly 20-hour trip. Mr. Haqmal and his family had fled war in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover last summer, only to find themselves fleeing Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Mr. Haqmal worked as an interpreter for the Canadian military in Afghanistan and had been living in a Kyiv hotel with his family since the end of August. His family of 12 were evacuated by Ukrainian special forces, a mission carried out after a request from The Globe to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Their stay in Ukraine was meant to be temporary but ended up feeling at times indefinite as they waited, and still wait, for resettlement approval from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or IRCC.

Canadians should brace for economic collateral damage as sanctions mount, Chrystia Freeland says

Canada will expand its Russia sanctions to target more Putin-friendly oligarchs and businesses, but Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland warns Canadians there will be an economic price for these punitive measures in support of Ukraine.

She said she discussed this with Group of Seven finance ministers Tuesday. “We said in order to be really be effective, in order to really have an impact, we are going to have to be prepared for there to be some adverse consequences for our own economies.”

For Moldova, welcoming Ukrainians combines kindness with economic self-interest

For three decades, one of Europe’s poorest countries has been emptying out: More than a million people have departed Moldova since 1991. They’re still leaving, at a pace of 35,000 a year. Across the country, 100,000 homes stand empty.

Now, Ukrainian refugees are pouring into Moldova – more than 88,000 so far – and its government and companies are scrambling to give them chances to work through acts of charity that coincide with a national need for labour.

The government is sweeping away legal barriers to their employment and opening its classrooms to Ukrainian teachers. Meanwhile, companies are offering jobs as graphic designers, office managers, construction workers, restaurant staff and IT workers.

But the tide of people also represents an economic opportunity to bring skills into a country that has struggled to keep its most talented at home.

No-fly zone over Ukraine out of the question for NATO

NATO countries are not considering imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said despite a plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that it would limit the number of people who die.

Mr. Johnson ruled out a no-fly zone while speaking at a news conference at Estonia’s Tapa military base on Tuesday, where British troops are leading the NATO battle group stationed there. The news came as Russian military aggression is expected to increase and after reports that Russia is indiscriminately bombing civilian areas.

“When it comes to a no fly-zone … in the skies above Ukraine, we have to accept the reality that, that involves shooting down Russian planes,” Mr. Johnson said. “That is a very, very big step that is simply not on the agenda of any NATO country.”

World Court to hear Ukraine and Russia case on March 7-8

The World Court on Tuesday said it will hold hearings on March 7-8 on whether to order “provisional measures” in a lawsuit brought by Ukraine against Russia seeking a halt to Moscow’s military actions in Ukraine.

The UN court said in a statement it had sent Russia an urgent communication to prepare in case it does order provisional measures, or immediate steps, to protect Ukraine, as it has requested.

The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, is the United Nations’ venue for resolving disputes between states.

Ukraine’s lawsuit filed on Sunday argues that Russia’s claim it invaded Ukraine to prevent a genocide is false.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that he had filed the lawsuit at the court over genocide accusations made by Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly asserted that Ukraine committed “genocide” in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, without presenting evidence, and said the invasion, called a “special operation” by Russian officials, was therefore justified to end it.

Beijing offers to play role in ending attack on Ukraine amid international criticism for appearing to stand by Russia

Chinese foreign ministry Wang Yi spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Tuesday, offering to play a role in ending the conflict as Beijing faces international criticism for appearing to stand by Russia following the invasion.

Ukraine said foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had pushed Mr. Wang to pressure Russia to stop the war. The Chinese readout said Kiev “is willing to strengthen communication with China and looks forward to China’s mediation to achieve a ceasefire.”

Beijing previously called for a diplomatic end to the conflict but stopped short of criticizing Moscow, with foreign ministry officials even unwilling to call the operation launched by Russia an “invasion.” This, as well as a show of unity by President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in early February, had been seen by many as proof the war had China’s tacit approval.

Canada to help Ukraine expedite petition to probe alleged war crimes by Russian force

Canada says it’s going to help Ukraine expedite its petition to the International Criminal Court to probe alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly says.

International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan has said he has decided to open an investigation and said the next step is to seek authorization from the court to proceed. But in a statement this week he signalled an alternative route that could speed up the process would be for a member state to refer the matter to his office.

Ms. Joly, in Geneva Tuesday, told reporters Canada will take this on. “Canada will petition the International Criminal Court … against Russia for crimes against humanity and war crimes. And it was also important for us to show that we are steadfast in terms of our support to Ukraine.”

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses entire staff after refusing to resign from Russian energy company boards

The entire staff of Gerhard Schroeder, the former German chancellor who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and an advocate of increasing Russian natural gas exports to Germany, has resigned in protest over his ties to the Kremlin.

The employees quit because they were embarrassed by Mr. Schroeder’s prominent roles at three Russian gas and pipeline companies, according to German media reports.

Those roles had enraged many Germans even before Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine last week. Some of his critics noted that Mr. Schroeder’s income ultimately came from a regime – the Russian government – that had launched an illegal and senseless war, in their view.

The situation is dire for all 285,000 residents of the city, which sits just 70 kilometres from the Belarusian border. But it’s particularly grim for the 11 children stuck in the local oncology ward, as food and medicines become increasingly scarce. “We actually don’t know how to survive here, It’s unreal. We don’t have any more resources,,” said Serhiy Zasimenko, the head of Evum, a non-governmental organization that supports the children’s oncology ward. “They’re in tough condition and need evacuation.”

Stocks slide on Ukraine uncertainty, crude back above US$100

European stocks sagged and oil jumped back above US$100 a barrel on Tuesday as markets struggled with massive uncertainty caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although the ruble steadied as Moscow scrambled support for its beleaguered markets.

Russia’s stock markets remained suspended and some bond trading platforms were no longer showing prices, but dealing in the major financial centres both in Europe and in Asia overnight was orderly, albeit jittery.

Losses for the Pan-European STOXX 600 were starting to mount again, with the index down nearly 2% by midsession and Wall Street expected to open around 1% lower in New York later.

Canada to petition ICC to probe alleged Russian war crimes

Canada will petition the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday to probe alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russian forces in Ukraine, its Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said.

The office of the ICC prosecutor on Monday said it will seek court approval to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine, just days after Russia’s invasion of its neighbour.

Joly, speaking to reporters in Geneva after taking part in a walkout of a virtual speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said: “Today also Canada will petition the International Criminal Court … against Russia for crimes against humanity and war crimes. And it was also important for us to show that we are steadfast in terms of our support to Ukraine”.

Red Cross appeals for aid amid ‘deteriorating’ humanitarian situation in Ukraine

Red Cross agencies appealed on Tuesday for US$273-million to provide food, water and shelter to millions of people in Ukraine where the humanitarian situation is “deteriorating rapidly” and to those who have fled abroad.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – the world’s largest disaster relief network – issued the joint appeal as a huge Russian armoured column bore down on Kyiv, six days after Moscow’s invasion began.

“We need the funds in order to address the humanitarian needs which are already staggering – food, water, shelter, health care, psychological support – and they are growing by the hour,” Martin Schuepp, ICRC regional director for Europe and Central Asia, told a news briefing.

For Ukrainian refugees in Poland, hope lives at the humble Marko Hotel

At any other time, the Hotel Marko would barely rate a glimpse from travellers as they sped along the highway outside Przemysl, which leads to Poland’s border with Ukraine.

The two-storey hotel is easy to miss despite its bright yellow walls and turret motif. It sits behind an empty furniture store and a deserted restaurant, both closed because of the pandemic.

The Marko’s 15 rooms – painted either green or white – offer few amenities for its three-star rating beyond a table, a couple of chairs, a television and a kettle.

There’s a broken fridge in the lobby selling warm soft drinks, and a rack of postcards featuring pictures of local attractions.

But ever since Russian bombs began pounding Ukraine last week, the Marko has become a haven for Ukrainians fleeing the war and something of a symbol of Polish generosity.

Russia to temporarily ban foreigners from selling assets

Russia will impose temporary curbs on foreign investors seeking to exit Russian assets to ensure they take a considered decision not one driven by political pressure, the prime minister said on Tuesday, as Moscow responds to Western sanctions.

Russian forces mount new offensive

A day after a shelling attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Russian forces have mounted a major new offensive, shelling Mariupol, surrounding Kherson, killing dozens of soldiers in Okhtyrka, striking a government building in central Kharkiv with a missile and advancing on Kyiv with a 65-kilometre long military convoy that has reached the outskirts of the capital.

The Russian assault will not stop until Moscow’s goals “are achieved,” Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday as air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine, including in Kyiv. Russia has said its objectives include “demilitarizing” Ukraine.

Ukraine’s Parliament says Belarusian troops have now entered Ukraine, joining the Russian attack on the northern city of Chernihiv. A resident in the city told The Globe and Mail Chernihiv is now completely surrounded.

Russian missiles hit city administration, residential areas, Kharkiv official says

Kharkiv region head Oleg Synegubov said on Tuesday Russian missile attacks hit the centre of Ukraine’s second-largest city, including residential areas and the city administration building, as Moscow started day six of its invasion.

Synegubov said Russia launched GRAD and cruise missiles on Kharkiv but that the city defence was holding. “Such attacks are genocide of the Ukrainian people, a war crime against the civilian population,” he said.

Wearing a flak jacket and a helmet, Synegubov said in a video posted on social media Tuesday morning that it was too early to know the number of casualties.

He shared a video showing Kharkiv regional administration building being hit by a missile and exploding.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify that video independently.

Zelensky urges West to impose no-fly zone over Ukraine

7:20 p.m.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging Western powers to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict with Russia, Reuters reported.

In a video address on Monday, Zelensky said it is time to block Russian missiles planes and helicopters from the country’s airspace.

“Fair negotiations can occur when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery at the very moment of negotiations,” Zelenskiy said.

Ukrainian officials have reported that Russian forces have started attacks in the city of Kharkiv, killing multiple citizens, including children.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki earlier on Monday ruled out the possibility of a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone, saying it could lead to direct war between the U.S. and Russia.

“That is definitely escalatory, that would potentially put us in a place where we are in a military conflict with Russia. That is not something [President Biden] wants to do,” Psaki said during an interview on MSNBC. “Those are all the reasons why that’s not a good idea.”

He added, however, that The Met still believes in the “warm friendship and cultural exchange that has long existed between the artists and artistic institutions of Russia and the United States.”

“The Metropolitan Opera opens its heart to the victims of the unprovoked war in Ukraine and salutes the heroism of the Ukrainian people,” Gelb said in a less-than-two-minute video, adding that Putin “seems intent on the destruction of Ukraine, its people and all personal freedom in Ukraine and Russia” and that “as an international opera company, the Met can help ring the alarm and contribute to the fight against oppression.”

Trudeau tweeted that the country will block imports of Russian crude oil, saying that “even though Canada has barely imported any Russian oil and gas in recent years, this move sends a powerful message” because a third of Russia’s budget comes from exporting oil.

Trudeau also said that Canada would send Ukraine anti-tank weapons systems and upgraded ammunition in addition to the equipment announced Sunday. The provisions will be the fourth shipment sent from Canada to Ukraine.

Trudeau added that Canada is also working on reviewing Russia Today’s content before allowing it to be shared on the radio, “because we cannot allow falsehoods, propaganda, and disinformation about Russia’s war to continue spreading in Canada.”

UN: Half a million Ukrainians have fled country as refugee numbers are ‘rising exponentially’

6:57 p.m.

Some 520,000 Ukrainians have fled their home since the start of Russian invasion, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Monday, adding that refugee totals are expected to run in the millions, taxing the resources of neighboring counties.

The figure has grown 10 times in just last week, when the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on Friday estimated that 50,000 Ukrainians had left the country. Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24.

“This figure has been rising exponentially hour after hour, literally since Thursday. I have worked in refugee crises for almost 40 years, and I have rarely seen such an incredibly fast rising exodus of people,” Commissioner Filippo Grandi said in a speech before the UN Security Council.

The majority of refugees — over 280,000 — have fled to Poland, while 94,000 have crossed the border into Hungary, roughly 40,000 are in Moldova, 34,000 are in Romania, 30,000 are in Slovakia, while Grandi said tens of thousands have landed in other European countries.

Other estimates indicate as many as 100,000 Ukrainians may be internally displaced.

Warner warns of Russian cyberattacks against US in ‘coming days and weeks’

5:23 p.m.

The chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the United States should expect Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. in the “coming days and weeks” in response to crippling sanctions.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said while there is a possibility of Russian spy services launching cyber-attacks on the U.S., attacks from Russian ransomware gangs are likely.

“I think we will probably see that in the coming days and weeks as Putin tries to lash out against these crippling level of sanctions we’ve put on him,” Warner said while appearing on a Washington Post live event.

The White House and the European Union have unleashed unprecedented economic sanctions in recent days that have strangled the Russian economy, sending the value of the ruble plummeting.

Warner has also raised the possibility that cyber-attacks launched by Putin could trigger NATO’s Article 5 collective defense principle, which says an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all, as well as warning of a dangerous cyber tit-for-tat between global powers.

“These can be extraordinarily destructive and if you get into the cyber escalation, you don’t know where it would end,” he said Monday.

European Space Agency: Planned joint mission with Russia ‘very unlikely’

The European Space Agency said Monday that the launch of a mission to Mars with Russia later this year is “very unlikely” after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We are fully implementing sanctions imposed on Russia by our Member States,” the agency said in a statement.

“Regarding the ExoMars program continuation, the sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely,” the statement added after a meeting with its nearly two dozen member states, noting that the director general would prepare to make a formal decision on the matter.

The launch, which intended to put a lander on Mars in an effort to determine if life had ever been there, was already postponed once amid COVID-19 concerns when it was initially scheduled for 2020, according to The Associated Press.

Russia’s Roscosmos space agency announced on Saturday that it would remove its personnel from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, the AP added.

“This step is a rejection of the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine. We take it with deep regret because of our great respect for the Russian people and our profound appreciation for the contributions of the many extraordinary Russian colleagues we have worked with,” MIT said in a statement.

Senior defense official: No sign yet of Belarusian forces fighting in Ukraine

12:50 p.m.

U.S. officials have not seen Belarusian troops involved in or preparing to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said Monday.

“We have seen no indications that Belarusian troops are being readied to move into Ukraine and certainly no indications that they are in fact moving or are in Ukraine,” the official told reporters. “Our best information is that the forces inside Ukraine are all Russians.”

Reports emerged earlier Monday that Belarus is preparing to send troops into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion which began last week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin so far has sent into Ukraine “just under 75 percent” of the more than 150,000 troops he had assembled for the assault, and forces have fired more than 380 missiles, the official said.

The Kremlin has already used Belarus as a location from which to pour its troops quickly across the border into Ukraine after insisting the large number of forces assembled there were for joint military drills.

The U.S. has also “seen some indications” that Russia in some areas of Ukraine is employing mercenaries from the shadowy Russian military contractor the Wagner Group, though details on where or how many are not clear.

The official also said Russian forces are frustrated they have not yet taken the capitol city of Kyiv, which could lead them to take a “more aggressive approach” militarily.

“They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv,” they said. “One of the things that that could result in is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt, in both the size and scale of their targeting of Kyiv.”

The Russians are “running out of gas and they’re having logistics problems” on the way south to Kyiv and have also met significant Ukrainian resistance.

Still, the Kremlin forces are roughly 16 miles away from the capital city, which they hope to encircle, according to the official.

“We do believe that their plans are to encircle the city and they try to take it that way because that has really been where the heaviest fighting has been,” they said.

Former Olympic gold medalist boxer joins Ukraine defense battalion

12:26 p.m.

Former Olympic boxer Vasiliy Lomachenko joined a territorial defense battalion in Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The 34 four-year-old shared an image to this Facebook page showing him armed and donning military gear on Sunday.

Lomachenko, a two-time gold medal winner, was in Greece when the invasion began, according to ESPN, and his flight home was delayed on Friday after air traffic in the region started being grounded. He reportedly flew into Bucharest instead, and traveled through Romania on Saturday to reach his home outside of Odessa to be with his family.

“We are so proud of our boxers, our real champions in boxing and champions in this war,” Mykola Kovalchuk, president of WBC Ukraine, said, according to ESPN. “We are proud to be Ukrainians.”

ESPN noted that Lomachenko, a former three-division champion, is closing in on a fight in Australia on June 5 against undisputed lightweight champion George Kambosos.

His decision to join the defense battalion comes after Hall of Fame boxer Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, announced he was taking up arms to defend the city against the Russian invaders, the sports news outlet reported. The mayor’s brother, fellow Hall of Famer and former heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko, also enlisted in the Ukrainian army reserve earlier this month before the invasion.

Suspected cluster munitions strike Ukraine’s second-largest city, killing 11

12:02 p.m.

At least 11 people were killed on Monday by suspected cluster munitions that struck Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine.

Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said at least 11 people had died as a result of the suspected cluster munitions, according to The Washington Post. He also said “dozens are dying.”

Reuters, citing the Ukrainian military, reported that dozens of people had died and hundreds were wounded in Kharkiv on Monday.

Synehubov said the acts constituted “a war crime,” according to the Post. Attacks took place in three areas of the city, which the Post said is mainly Russian-speaking and is considered more friendly toward Moscow.

The shelling occurred when several individuals in the city were waiting to enter grocery stores and other shops to replace supplies amid the Russian invasion, the newspaper noted.

“The Russian enemy is shelling entire residential areas of Kharkiv, where there is no critical infrastructure, where there are no positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that the Russians could aim at,” Synehubov said in a Telegram message, according to the Post.

Ukraine foreign minister says nation ‘not ready to surrender or capitulate’

11:50 a.m.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba on Monday said the country will not capitulate to Russia’s demands as delegations from both countries held talks at the Belarus border.

In an interview with CNBC, Kuleba said he wasn’t convinced the talks would be successful.

“I’m a diplomat, I have to believe in the success of talks, but at the same time my main goal as a diplomat now is to impose more sanctions on Russia, to bring more weapons to Ukraine and to isolate Russia as much as we can in the international arena so I’m focused on this part of diplomacy,” he said.

“We stand not only for ourselves but for the world order as we all know it,” he added.

According to The Associated Press, Ukraine sent its defense minister and other top officials, while the Russian delegation was led by Putin’s adviser on culture.

Kuleba tweeted on Sunday that what is happening now in Ukraine is a “real people’s war.”

“We will not fall. We will not stop or get tired. We are determined to fight back fiercely as long as it is needed to defend our land and our people,” he said on Sunday.

Switzerland breaks from policy of neutrality, adopting EU sanctions against Russia

11:12 a.m.

Switzerland will adopt the European Union’s sanctions against Russia, marking a break from its traditional policy of neutrality.

The Swiss government announced on Monday that it would impose financial sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov. Switzerland, a longtime safe haven of Russian assets, also said it would target the assets of certain companies and individuals.

The country will also close its airspace to flights from Russia except for humanitarian, medical or diplomatic purposes. In addition, it will ban entry to people linked to Switzerland with a connection to Putin.

Switzerland has had a ban on imports, exports and investments from Crimea and Sevastopol since 2014, but that policy will also be expanded to the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the government said.

It also said it would deliver rounds of relief supplies for Ukrainians fleeing their country to Poland, a neighboring nation that has taken in thousands of refugees since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.

The executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday recommended that athletes from Russia and Belarus not be invited or permitted to participate in the Games.

“While athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to continue to participate in sports events, many athletes from Ukraine are prevented from doing so because of the attack on their country,” the board’s statement said, adding that it is “a dilemma which cannot be solved.”

The board went on to say that the recommendation came with a “heavy heart.” Its statement also called on organizers of international sports to do “everything in their power to ensure that no athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus” even if it is not possible to prevent the participation of those athletes entirely.

FIFA, which is the global governing body of soccer, has prohibited matches in Russia and banned the Russian flag and national anthem in any competition. Russian would instead play under the name “Football Union of Russia (RFU).”

The European Union is preparing to allow Ukrainians fleeing their country amid Russia’s invasion to remain in the EU for up to three years.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said at least 400,000 Ukrainians have entered the bloc thus far, according to Reuters.

“We have to prepare for millions (to arrive in the EU),” Johansson said during a news conference, the news service reported. She added that she hoped the EU’s interior ministers could provide plans for those leaving Ukraine as soon as Thursday.

Johansson was reportedly asked by the ministers to prepare proposals that would invoke the EU temporary protection directive, which is meant to provide protections for displaced people in the bloc for one to three years. The directive was created after the war in the Balkans in the 1990s, but has yet to be used, Reuters noted.

China: Sanctions will make ‘political settlement’ between Ukraine, Russia more difficult

China is condemning Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, arguing that such penalties will make a “political settlement” between Moscow and Kyiv more difficult.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a briefing on Monday said Beijing is against “unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law,” according to The Associated Press.

“Facts have long proven that sanctions could not help solve problems but create new issues,” Wang said, according to the AP. “It will not only result in a lose-lose or multi-lose situation economically, but also disrupt the process of political settlement.”

Kremlin knocks EU’s ‘hostile’ measures

The Kremlin on Monday knocked the European Union’s “hostile” measures after the bloc announced that it was funding weapons and equipment deliveries to Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a news briefing that the EU was “taking an unfriendly position” toward Russia and “taking measures that are not friendly, but hostile towards us,” according to Reuters.

He also argued that the latest moves from the bloc confirmed that Moscow was correct in launching a military operation against Ukraine.

“This, once again, confirms that Russia was right about the measures that are being taken in order to ensure the demilitarization of the country,” Peskov reportedly said.

The comments come after EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Twitter Sunday that the bloc would be financing the purchase and delivery of weapons to Ukraine. She noted that it marked the first time the union had made such a move.

Peskov on Monday said weapons sent to Ukraine would become “an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor” that could cause dangerous long-term consequences rather than bring stability back to the region, according to Reuters.
