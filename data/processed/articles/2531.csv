On the ground in Kyiv, war has pulled life and light from the streets and sent it underground into dark bunkers, basements and bomb shelters.

Cosy coffee kiosks are now shut, shops with the latest fashions are shuttered, supermarket shelves are emptying.

The city’s cobbled lanes are now strewn with ugly anti-tank barricades, known as hedgehogs, to stop the Russian army’s advance.

But in this beleaguered capital, the bells still ring out, reassuringly on the hour, in the magnificent golden-domed St Michael’s Cathedral.

It knows a thing or two about war.

Sacked down through the centuries, demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s during Stalin’s rule.

But it rose again.

And now in 2022 Ukrainians draw strength from this history, their faith in themselves and their future.

Around the world many now ask how high a price will Ukraine have to pay: Why not give up now to avoid this searing pain as the Russian vice squeezes ever tighter?

And that may seem from afar to be a sensible solution.

But Ukraine’s writer Andrey Kurkov reminds us that as Russia’s troops move into Ukrainian cities they are being met, not by white flags of surrender, but by the yellow and blue standard of Ukraine – still standing, for now, in this second week of a war we’re all watching.

Thirty-three people died Thursday when Russian forces hit residential areas, including schools and a high-rise apartment building, in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, officials said.

Ukraine's emergencies service said 18 people were also injured in the attack, updating an earlier toll.

The town of Chernihiv lies 120 kilometres (75 miles) northeast of Kyiv, which the Russian forces have been trying to invade from the north.

Chernihiv's deputy mayor Regina Gusak told AFP that the city was hit by a Russian ""bombing attack"".

Ukraine's emergencies service released images showing plumes of smoke coming out of heavily damaged apartments, with debris scattered across a yard and rescuers carrying bodies on stretchers.

""Russian aircraft also attacked two schools in the Staraya Podusivka area (of Chernihiv) and private homes. Rescuers are working in the area,"" the governor of the Chernihiv region, Vyacheslav Chaus, said on Telegram.

Since it invaded Ukraine a week ago, Russia has said that it does not target civilian areas, despite widespread evidence to the contrary.

Ukraine says at least 350 civilians have been killed since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his attack.

The strikes came as Ukraine and Russia officials gathered for talks on a ceasefire on the Belarus-Poland border Thursday.

Putin on Thursday vowed to carry on with his advance in Ukraine in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron.

The Russian leader has showed no signs of backing down even as a barrage of Western sanctions is set to destroy Moscow's economy.

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

Russia voted against the measure, joined by Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/04/world/russia-ukraine
