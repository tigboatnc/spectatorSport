Ukraine’s capital has also been under attack with constant artillery fire and first cruise missile attacks already recorded.

Explosions have been so far heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and Kramatorsk, while shelling in the Russian-backed separatist territories has been somewhat of a constant over the past days.

While reports initially said Russian troops had landed in Odessa, this was disputed by the Ukrainian military.

Information available so far indicates that an advance into Ukraine is coming from Crime, Belgorod and Belarus, in an operation that seems to have been designed to achieve objectives fast. Exactly what the objectives of the operation are remains to be seen.

Russian news outlet said Russian strikes are targeting military infrastructure, including air bases and defenses as well as naval bases.

After months of discussions that followed the buildup of Russian forces in Ukraine failed, Russia shifted to false flag operations in an attempt to justify an all-out attack against its neighbor. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin appears to have given up on that effort, deciding to launch the operation in the early morning hours of February 24.

It was 5 o'clock in the morning Kyiv time Putin started an unprovoked war against Ukraine, a war against Europe, a war against the whole world — Ukraine's Emb. to UK (@UkrEmbLondon) February 24, 2022

Unconfirmed Reports coming in from Ukraine say that the Belarussian military was also involved in the invasion.

The attack comes a day after Putin announced that he had decided to “conduct a special military operation” in connection with the situation in the Donbass.

“I have decided to conduct a special military operation. Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to harassment and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. And for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. As well as bringing to justice those who committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including citizens of the Russian Federation,” Putin said.

Several hours after the invasion started, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that he had already talked to US president Joe Biden, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, UK prime minister Boris Jonson and European Union leaders, urging them to stop “Putin’s war against Ukraine and the world immediately!”

He also pledged for assistance close the airspace in Ukraine and “forcing Russia into peace.”

“By its unprovoked and unjustified military actions, Russia is grossly violating international law and undermining European and global security and stability. We call on Russia to immediately cease the hostilities, withdraw its military from Ukraine and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. Such use of force and coercion has no place in the 21st century,” the European Council and European Commission said in a joint statement, adding that NATO and G7 leaders will be meeting on Thursday in response to the situation.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable,” a White House statement said.

Local media quoted the Russian Defense Ministry as saying it has started “the disabling of Ukraine’s military infrastructure, including military airfields”.

However, reports from Ukraine indicate Russian military is targeting civilian infrastructure in the different cities and air raid sirens and explosion heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

24 Feb 2022 01.53 Andrew Roth Video footage indicates that Russian rockets have hit population centres in major Ukrainian cities despite claims by the Russian military that it is only targeting military infrastructure. Images from the city of Kharkiv showed what appeared to be the tail section of a rocket fired from a Smerch heavy multiple rocket launcher. The rocket’s payload failed to explode on impact and it was left sticking out of the pavement in the city close to an Orthodox church. CIT, an open-source research group, confirmed that the video was shot in Kharkiv and that the tali section resembled a Smerch rocket. The use of those rockets against population centres is a “war crime,” the group claims. Мы проверили: видео действительно снято в Харькове, виден хвост ракетной части реактивного снаряда РСЗО «Смерч».

Russian media have reported that Putin likely pre-recorded his declaration of war as early as Monday. Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta found that the metadata on the video file uploaded to the Kremlin website was created at 7pm on February 21, nearly three days before Putin announced the beginning of his military operation on Thursday morning.

He is wearing the same tie and seated at the same desk when he announced his recognition of the Russian-controlled territories on Monday, and when he announced the start of his military operation on Thursday. Evidence, incl metadata, suggests Putin’s war speech recorded already three days in advance. So many people must have known what was going to happen. https://t.co/p0peV1ivPG — Martin Kragh (@MartinKragh1) February 24, 2022 The Kremlin and its allies have already been caught for pre-recording other events that were supposedly broadcast live, like the meeting of the Kremlin’s Security Council or announcements of evacuations from Donetsk and Luhansk territories. But if true, the pre-recording of Putin’s declaration of war would further suggest that the Kremlin never took the diplomatic path seriously and was always preparing to launch an invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s interior ministry adviser says shelling across Ukraine has killed one and wounded another in Brovary in the Kyiv region. Ukraine’s military added that two Russian tanks and several trucks in eastern Ukraine were seen while Russia is moving military equipment across from annexed Crimea. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists say they now control two towns in the Luhansk region of Ukraine, according to a report from RIA new agency. This report was confirmed by Ukraine police who later said two villages in Luhansk region seized. Russia’s defence ministry said it has taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian air bases and degraded Ukraine’s air defences, Russian news agencies reported. The Russian ministry denied reports that one of its aircraft had been downed over Ukraine. Ukraine’s military said earlier that five Russian planes and one helicopter had been shot down over its Luhansk region.

Kyle Rodda of IG Markets in Melbourne said the spike could be part of a pincer movement of prices that force the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to rais einterest rates into the teeth of inflation. He said: A civil war would be both a huge growth shock to the European – and global economy – and inflation shock. That’s a dangerous mix, because the supply disruptions in commodity prices would drive costs higher, and exacerbate the inflation central banks are already struggling to contain. That means despite, this the Fed – and others – would be unable to buffet the shock, and would potentially have to tighten policy – a very negative scenario for risk assets. The Russian rouble dropped 5.4% earlier to hit a record low against the euro and its lowest since 2016 against the US dollar. Trade in the currency was later suspended.

24 Feb 2022 01.31 UN security briefing held as war broke Julian Borger In case you missed the United Nations emergency security briefing earlier, the Guardian’s Julian Borger has compiled a rundown. Vladimir Putin delivered his speech while an emergency session of the UN security council was underway. It will go down as one of the most surreal sessions the chamber has ever witnessed, as the very war it was supposed to prevent, broke out while it was sitting. The secretary general, Antonio Guterres, was the first to speak, and at that time, Putin’s intentions were not entirely clear. But Guterres pointed to the reports of troops moving into position, and did something notable and rare for a UN secretary general: he publicly called out the head of a security council permanent member.

“If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say, from the bottom of my heart,” Guterres said. “President Putin - stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.” By the time it was time for the Russian permanent representative, Vasily Nebenzya, to speak, Putin had given his address, and there was no more mystery. Peace was not to be given a chance, after all. Nebenzya, who had spent weeks deriding western states for their “hysterical” warnings of impending invasion, pivoted to argue it was not actually a war that was getting underway, but a “special military operation” to protect the people of the Donbas. The Ukrainian ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, had been waiting for his turn to speak while receiving constant updates from Kyiv. When his time came, he had to dispense with his prepared speech because, he said, “most of it is already useless”. Instead he held up a copy of the UN Charter, a small sky blue booklet, and read the clause that said UN membership was open to all peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the charter. “Russia is not able to carry out any of those obligations,” Kyslytsya declared.

He challenged Nebenzya to deny that Ukraine was under attack. “You have a smartphone,” he said, taunting the Russian to check with his boss, the foreign minister, on what was really going on. “You can call Lavrov right now. We can make a pause to let you go out and call him.” Nebenzya declined. “I have already said all I know at this point,” he said. “Waking up Minister Lavrov at this time is not something I plan to do.” An hour or so into the meeting, the multiplying reports of bombardment of Ukrainian cities had reached the chamber, and if the futility of the council’s calls for peace and dialogue had not been clear before, they were now agonisingly obvious.

Some ambassadors demanded to speak for a second time to express their sense of betrayal. “At the exact time as we were gathered in the council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,” the US permanent representative, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said. “This is a grave emergency.” Her British counterpart, Barbara Woodward declared it “a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations.” Kyslytsya himself was trembling with emotion. He stared at Nebenzya and demanded the Russian relinquish his duties as chair of the council. “There is no purgatory for war criminals,” he warned him. “They go straight to hell.”

At that point, Nebenzya quickly closed the meeting, claiming that Russia’s aggression was not directed at the Ukrainian people, but “against the junta that is in power in Kiev”. Then he adjourned and left. A security council that had begun, just about, in peacetime, had broken up in a time of war, and perhaps at the start of a major conflict.

Furthermore, he said, ""A minute ago I had a conversation with President Biden. The US have already started uniting international support. Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defense and security is working.""

A White House spokesman said Joe Biden ""just spoke with Zelensky"" and that details of the conversation will be announced later.

A special military op

The Russian president authorized a special military operation on Donbass this Thursday morning.

""Leading NATO countries pursue their own goal by fully supporting Ukraine's extreme Nazis and neo-Nazis, who, in turn, will never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for their free choice to reunify with Russia"", said Putin.

""They will, of course, go to Crimea, like to Donbass, the way they do it, to kill, like executioners from the bands of Ukrainian Nazi supporters of Hitler were killing innocent people during World War II"".

""The circumstances make us take decisive and immediate actions. The people's republics of Donbass asked Russia for assistance"", he added.

""In this regard, in accordance with Article 51, Part 7 of the UN Charter, with the sanction of the Federation Council and in pursuance of the friendship and mutual assistance treaties with the DPR and LPR, ratified by the Federal Assembly, I have decided to conduct a special military operation"".

He says that though war is a dirty business, NATO has not been acting out of morality, saying Russia cannot develop, feel safe, or exist with constant threats from Ukraine.",https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/ukraine-declares-nationwide-martial-law
