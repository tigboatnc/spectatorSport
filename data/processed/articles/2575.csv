Kyiv rocked by four huge explosions as 'white flash' streaks across the sky

At least four explosions have rocked the Ukraine capital Kyiv with reports of two major blasts in the city centre followed by two further attacks close to a metro station.

Terrifying footage appears to show the enormous blasts in the early hours of Thursday with reports of a 'white flash' streaking across the sky.

In a video shared online a CBS reporter can be seen ducking for cover as ear-shattering explosions erupt behind him.

CBS News International Correspondent Charlie D'Agata was broadcasting live from a rooftop in Kyiv when a blast took him by surprise.

Air raid sirens have also been sounding in the city that is under siege from the Russian army with the night sky lit up by fire balls.

It is possible that Russian missiles may have hit a power line, whether deliberately or not, so as to create such large explosions.

People have been fleeing the city in their thousands over the past week while others have sheltered in the underground metros.

The UN refugee agency says 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion, in the swiftest exodus of refugees this century.

The Russians appear to have failed with an initial plan to quickly take over Kyiv but it is also feared that a long drawn out siege will lead to many civilian casualties.

Earlier, a Russian rocket was shot down with debris scattered close to Kyiv railway station, reportedly said the Ukraine Ministry for Defence.

It is thought that the missile was aimed at a government building.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky published a video on Thursday morning, urging people to keep up the fight.

He said: ""Every occupier should know they will receive a fierce rebuff from the Ukrainians.

""We are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week but we stopped them.""

At the same time, in Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, suffered heavy bombardment on Wednesday.

The human toll was mounting in the city of 1.5 million people, where bombing has left its centre a wasteland of ruined buildings and debris.

""The Russian 'liberators' have come,"" one Ukrainian volunteer lamented sarcastically, as he and three others strained to carry the dead body of a man wrapped in a bedsheet out of the ruins on a main square.

A UN resolution reprimanding Moscow was supported by 141 of the assembly's 193 members, passed in a rare emergency session, a symbolic victory for Ukraine that increases Moscow's international isolation.

""More is at stake even than the conflict in Ukraine itself. This is a threat to the security of Europe and the entire rules-based order,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after the vote.

Reuters witnesses in the centre of the city of 3.4 million people could not immediately confirm the cause of the blasts, but they were more frequent than in recent days and some were louder. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv yet, the capital has been shelled and Russian forces unleashed fierce firepower to try to break resistance in the nearby town of Borodyanka.

Drone footage from the town to the northwest of Kyiv on Thursday showed flattened houses and a badly damaged apartment block, with some homes charred and still on fire. Burned out military vehicles littered a main road.

In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, some 18 km west of the centre, the twisted metal remnants of a missile, which Ukrainian air defences apparently downed overnight, lay in the middle of a street a few metres from a bus station.

Tens of thousands of residents have fled the capital to the relative safety of the west of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Many remain, and on Friday some people's message for the Russian military was one of defiance.

Liliya, a woman wearing a black coat and pointing at the missile debris, said Moscow was guilty of ""genocide"" against Ukraine.

""These bloodthirsty creatures came to kill us,"" she said.

Nearby, Igor Leonidovich, a bespectacled man of 62, described himself as an ethnic Russian and said he moved to Ukraine as a boy over 50 years ago.

""They all (Russian invaders) should go to hell,"" he said. ""I cannot believe what I am seeing with my own eyes. The situation is deteriorating for everyone, but especially for occupying forces.""

Russia says its actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.

Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss that description and call it an unjustified invasion. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two and more than a million people have fled abroad.

In downtown Kyiv, the streets were a far cry from their pre-war vibrancy. But people went about their daily business and soldiers at a checkpoint of concrete blocks and metal spikes laughed as they shared breakfast.

As air raid sirens went off, some residents remained in queues outside pharmacies and food stores, while others took a stroll in a park.

The city center in Odessa is a ghost town. Barricaded with sandbags, this is a city ready for battle.

The bombing hasn’t started, but Ukraine’s third largest city on the southern coast appears as if it’s already under bombardment.

For days, Odessa’s residents have been warned of the possibility of a Russian amphibious landing. Young residents now know it is their turn to fight. Some civilians have already taken up arms.

Scarred from a war for the last generation, locals are on edge as Russian forces encroach on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. They say this is just like an episode that causes their grandparents to burst into nervous tears when they recall the horror of 1941 during the assault by Nazi Germany.

A food hall has been hurriedly converted into a well-oiled machine designed to sustain the city’s youth with medicine and other essential supplies. The city’s nearby Opera House is fortified – just as it was more than eight decades ago.

One man, Nick, tells me he couldn't help but weep after seeing a photograph of the building barricaded.

""It is impossible to imagine that this picture in reality, it is only our memory,"" he said.

But while it can feel like everyone is staying to fight, trains are filling with people – young mothers and their children – desperate to escape.

Explosions have rocked Ukraine's capital Kyiv overnight amid widespread uncertainty over whether Russia will launch a full assault on the capital in the coming hours and days. Massive blasts were heard and filmed in the city last night, with one video on social media showing a huge fireball rising in the city's sky. It's unknown what the targets of the explosions were, or whether there have been casualties caused by the blasts. NBC News is working to verify camera footage posted online purporting to show explosions hitting the city. More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the Russian invasion a week ago, but many have stayed and taken up arms to fight Russian forces. Many of Kyiv's residents, including children, also remain in the city, living or seeking shelter in subway stations, basements and underground bunkers when air raid sirens warn of incoming strikes.

Russia has said Kyiv's residents will be allowed to evacuate the city in the direction of Vasylkiv, to the southwest of the city. ""There will not be any obstacles from Russian military personnel for the exit of the civilian population,"" Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, said on Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency TASS. This is the second time that Russia has warned Kyiv's residents to leave the city, with Konashenkov insisting on Monday that the route toward Vasylkiv was ""open and safe,"" despite reports of Russian missile strikes on the town. The following image shows damage purportedly caused by Russian missile strikes on Vasylkiv.

The convoy

As many residents of Kyiv take shelter in underground stations and bunkers, the decision of whether to stay or go — and to risk possible harm and death in the process of leaving — has become acute this week, particularly as concerns grow that Russia could be poised to launch an all-out assault on the city. Fears have grown after satellite images emerged at the start of the week showing a huge convoy of Russian military vehicles, estimated to be around 40 miles long, slowly snaking its way toward the capital. The following satellite image was taken by U.S firm Maxar Technologies on Monday. It appears to show a convoy of Russian armored tanks and trucks that stretched from Pybirsk, further north of Kyiv, to the Antonov airport (also known as the Hostomel airport — the site of fighting last week between Russian and Ukrainian forces) on the northwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

The convoy has reportedly been held up on its way to Kyiv, however, amid unconfirmed reports of food and fuel shortages. When asked about the convoy's progress and position at a press briefing on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Department Spokesman John Kirby said ""we still assess that that convoy, but more broadly speaking the northern push by the Russians down towards the south, towards Kyiv, remains stalled."" ""From our best estimates have not made any appreciable progress geographically speaking in the last 24 to 36 hours,"" he added. The U.S. defense official believed there were several reasons for the delay: ""One, we believe the Russians are deliberately, actually, regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up for lost time. Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistics and sustainment challenges, challenges that we don't believe they fully anticipated."" Lastly, he said, Russian forces have experienced ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" with indications — although the U.S. could not completely independently verify them — that ""Ukrainians have in fact tried to slow down that convoy."" Britain's Ministry of Defense confirmed the United States' assessment of the convoy on Thursday, issuing an intelligence update in which it said ""the main body of the large Russian column … remains over 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion."" The ministry also believed that ""the column has made little discernible progress in over three days."" Jack Watling, a research fellow for land warfare and military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said there were a number of logistical challenges that the convoy faces. ""When you have that many vehicles on a very small number of roads you need to move fuel and food and large quantities of it along that road so you're continually having to move the vehicles aside and then at the other end you're having to work who's going to go where and what they're going to do,"" he said. ""So I think the Russians are trying to sort themselves out, as it were, and shake out at the other end and prepare for what they want to do to Kyiv,"" he told the BBC's ""Today"" program on Thursday.

Dire situation

Kyiv is only one of the a number of key cities that Russian forces are hoping to seize following their invasion of Ukraine. Other key strategic cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have been the scenes of fierce fighting. There are reports that Russian forces have taken control of Kherson in the south, with the city's mayor announcing on Facebook Wednesday evening that Russians had imposed a curfew and other rules on residents. The mayor, Igor Kolykhayev, warned residents not to provoke the Russian military.
