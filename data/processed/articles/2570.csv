2,99003cac-6668-4d53-8653-0cbe608bc3c9,[],2022-03-03,"Ukraine in brief:

(description of battles is taken from the Armed Forces data)

The occupiers continue to use civilians as human shields, taking hostages. Contrary to the norms of international humanitarian law, the Russians use high-power cluster munitions and fragmentation munitions during bombings. During the artillery strikes on the settlements, the occupiers actively used the “Hrad”, “Smerch” and “Urahan” multiple rocket launchers.

In the Volyn direction, the enemy turned to defensive actions and tried to stay on the border Bigun, Ovruch, Pirozhky, Riznia, Ukrainka.

In Polissya, the occupiers concentrated their main efforts in the Kyiv direction, incurring losses in personnel and equipment, but did not abandon attempts to block KYIV from the northern and north-western directions. Military groups remain in the Brovary area.

Russian troops are also trying to advance on Kyiv from Chernihiv. Enemy troops are forced to put reserves into operation.

The occupiers continue their attempts to resume offensive operations in the Chernihiv region – Nizhyn and Pryluky.

In the Kharkiv region, after illegally crossing the state border of Ukraine, enemy troops were stopped at the border in the areas of Okhtyrka, Bohodukhiv, Chuguiv, and Shevchenkove. The occupiers are forced to defend themselves near Kharkiv.

In the Sumy direction, the occupiers continue to besiege the settlements of Sumy, Lebedyn and Okhtyrka.

Enemy is also advancing towards the Dnipro and Zaporizhia.

Mariupol is stable in the Donetsk region, and the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are inaccessible to the enemy.

According to activists, one of the challenges today is the evacuation of the population from the shelling zones, there are problems with fuel, food, electricity and heat. One of the dangers is also the enemy’s offense in the direction of Energodar, where the nuclear power plant is located. There are frequent shellings from the sky, houses and social infrastructure are being destroyed, which is why it is so important that NATO and the EU cover the skies over Ukraine.

Northern regions

Kyiv oblast

On the night of March 3rd, four explosions were heard in Kyiv. Air alarms continue to be heard in the cities and villages of Kyiv region. The Zhytomyr highway, the Bucha-Irpin-Gostomel highway, and the north of the Vyshhorod district remain dangerous. The house where the founder of the “Active Community” lives was almost shelled.

More than 1,500 women and children were evacuated from Irpin and Bucha. 200 people were evacuated from Borodyanka, who were trapped under the rubble of buildings for more than two days, in basements and cellars.
